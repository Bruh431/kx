### Leader Bios ###
SCT_MACCORKMICK_DESC:0"A Lawyer, a Nationalist, and now the leader of a rebellion in Scotland. These are all positions held by John MacCormick, the man who hopes to free the Scottish Nation from English Tyranny. From an early age MacCormick was a fervent supporter of Scottish Home Rule, a position he would hold for the rest of his life. However, despite his oratory talents and large support base; Scottish Nationalism was suppressed by the more radical factions within the now Union of Britain; something exacerbated by his acceptance of more right-wing groups into his organization. Within time his organization was forced to go underground. This was the foundation of the modern Homeland Watch; an organization that was nothing but a fringe terror group at the time. But, as the Union of Britain disintegrated under Mosley’s totalitarian rule, the Homeland Watch took control over Scotland where the Brits had failed. And with the government crippled, MacCormick saw his chance to finally break the shackles that England has imposed on Scotland. The time was now, Scotland was to be free and there was no longer anyone to stop it."

We must honor the Declaration and make our forefathers proud of us! For it is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom - for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself."

SCT_peace_with_socialists:0 "Deal With The Socialists"
SCT_peace_with_socialists_desc:0 "The socialists of Scotland are not entirely content with our rule. Many took up arms against us and will gladly do so again. It is time to decide what to do with these violent groups, either casting them out entirely or attempting to make peace with them."
SCT_political_pluralism:0 "Promote Political Pluralism"
SCT_political_pluralism_desc:0 "The Maximists tried to destroy the very notion of opposition and it was in this fury that Scotland was galvanized. We will not make the same mistakes and instead promote moderate political discouse and greater pluralism."
SCT_local_democracy:0 "Local Democracy"
SCT_local_democracy_desc:0 "Scotland’s system of parishes and cities comes from a vastly outdated and unionist view of the country.

In doing so we will usher in a more accountable local democratic system for all Scottish people." 
SCT_homeland_watch:0 "Deal With The Watch"
SCT_homeland_watch_desc:0 "The Homeland Watch is a nationalist paramilitary group that fought during the initial rising and prevented more radical elements from usurping our power during the elections. A major question still lingers: what is to be done with the group?"
SCT_entrenched_liberty:0 "Entrenched Liberty"

SCT_religious_issues:0 "The Sectarian Divide"
SCT_religious_issues_desc:0 "One of the few issues that the mainstream democratic political parties have agreed on is that the curse of sectarianism must be either contained, or alternative arrangements found. Either way, all are in agreement that such divides only make Scotland weaker."
SCT_negotiate:0 "Unionist Negotiations"
SCT_negotiate_desc:0 "It has been decided the best way to deal with Scotland’s sectarian issues is to simply negotiate with the Unionists. To make them feel truly included in Scotland’s own democracy, a democracy that takes inspiration from the mother of all parliaments that they previously paid homage to."
SCT_union_autonomy:0 "Autonomy For Unionists"
SCT_union_autonomy_desc:0 "It has been decided that Unionists may never truly embrace the new Scotland, which is perfectly and is their right as citizens in the North Atlantic’s finest democracy, however we cannot have them causing trouble for their own political ends. A system of autonomous council areas within Glasgow and the West of Scotland has been advocated as a solution for this problem."
SCT_free_thought:0 "Promote Free Thought"
SCT_free_thought_desc:0 "The suppression of thought was key to Maximist rule. In our new Scotland we will instead promote the opposite and provide a safe haven to scientists and political dissenters as well as liberating our own people."

SCT_liberalize_desc:0 "The Scotland of tomorrow will be one that embraces the ideas of our own national son, Adam Smith. With the election of the fiscal right, the Scottish people have signalled a desire to end the Syndicalist rhetoric of the past, and usher in an economy of free market prosperity!"
SCT_austerity:0 "Implement Austerity"
SCT_austerity_desc:0 "Paying for the mechanisms of the new Scottish State has proven costly, and as a result, there is simply not enough money to continue much of the Provisional Government’s wartime welfare programmes. The market shall provide, not the government."
SCT_balance_books:0 "Balance The Books"
SCT_balance_books_desc:0 "Austerity seems to be paying off. Our international debt is being slashed, and the populace are growing less and less dependent on state aid. Our centres of international finance flourish!"
SCT_privatisation:0 "Privatize The Oil Fields"
SCT_privatisation_desc:0 "The best way for us to capitalise on Scotland’s oil fields is to leave it in the hands of private business. The market best allocates resources, and our burgeoning oil industry will bear fruit for years to come!"
SCT_socialism:0 "For the common man"
SCT_socialism_desc:0 "The common weal has prevailed. The notion that all people are entitled to shelter, food, and healthcare as a fundamental human right. Scotland has always had an inclination towards humanitarianism and Social Democracy, let us show the world what a truly transformative Social Democratic state can accomplish!"
SCT_welfare:0 "Implement Welfare Measures"
SCT_welfare_desc:0 "Ours will not be a government motivated merely by material gain, nor will we allow ourselves to grow complacent as Scotland begins to find its feet. All of Scotland’s people must be cared for from cradle to grave. The limited welfare of the Provisional Government will be expanded on."
SCT_new_economics:0 "Schachtian Economics"
SCT_new_economics_desc:0 "The same slow and steady economic model implemented by the German Empire has much to teach us. Schactian economics is pulling Germany out of an economic mire, it can do the same for us!"
SCT_democratic_oil:0 "North Sea Oil"
SCT_democratic_oil_desc:0 "Large deposits of Oil and Gas have been found off of the coast of Scotland. Exploiting these newfound natural resources will benefit us greatly"
SCT_new_constitution:0 "The New Constitution"
SCT_new_constitution_desc:0 "When the Christian Salvesen maritime company made the discovery of the North Sea shelf in Scotland’s maritime jurisdiction, nobody could figure out exactly how to capitalise on this new resource. Our government is set to nationalise Christian Salvesen, and all the richest of the North Sea."

SCT_benevolent_dictatorship: "A Father To The Nation"
SCT_benevolent_dictatorship_desc:0 "John MacCormick has used his influence in both the Homeland Watch, and their leading role in the Provisional Government to seize the apparatus of power in an almost silent coup. Dissenting publications and community groups have found their offices and meeting halls vandalised by unidentified thugs. It seems the quest for a Scottish National Renaissance will be successful at any cost."
SCT_defang_parliament:0 "Defang Parliament"
SCT_defang_parliament_desc:0 "Many voices in the initial days of the Rising called for a Constitutional Democratic Scotland. While this is, of course, ultimately in our own interests, Scotland in its current state simply cannot be trusted to tread this path. Parliament must be brought to heel by the Homeland Watch if we are to continue to steer the ship with clear conscience."
SCT_control_opposition:0 "Controlled Opposition"
SCT_control_opposition_desc:0 "With Parliament sufficiently neutered it no longer serves much of a credible threat. Despite this many of the democratic parties within parliament continue to rally against us. These elements must be brought into the fold until it is time to remove the leash."
SCT_scots_education:0 "A Scots' Education"
SCT_scots_education_desc:0 "Ireland has seen limited success in attempting to reintroduce their traditional language. We believe that we can do better. Radical plans are being drawn up at each of Scotland’s old universities for a new curriculum that will teach Scotland’s children the correct way to act and speak. Scottish English must be stamped out, and the Auld Scots tongue restored. The future of our country depends on it. "
SCT_empower_watch:0 "Empower The Watch"
SCT_empower_watch_desc:0 "It would be naïve to think that the Homeland Watch would simply go away with the Provisional Government. John MacCormick understands this, and he also understands that these are men passionate about the future of their country and cultural kin. Local authorities must be administered by the Homeland Watch and their force of arms, not by untrustworthy agents of Unionism, Popery, Religious extremism or Syndicalism."
SCT_ban_covenanters:0 "Reign In The Covenanters"
SCT_ban_covenanters_desc:0 "The Covenanters are a strange group. While we see eye to eye on some issues there more...extreme views are proving a hindrance. Backed by fanatical warriors and a charismatic leader, it is time to eliminate them before they can become a sufficient threat."
SCT_venerate_our_heroes:0 "Venerate Our Heroes"
SCT_venerate_our_heroes_desc:0 "How far we have come. Bruce and Wallace would be proud. In an age of industry and machine gun, we have triumphed over England yet again in the pursuit of a Nation of our own. We must ensure that every Scottish child grows up knowing the stories of Bannockburn and Stirling Bridge. "
SCT_martial_law:0 "Establish Martial Law"
SCT_martial_law_desc:0 "Sectarian issues; left over arms caches, Maximist resistance. All of these problems continue to plague blessed Caledonia at a time where we need unity more than anything else. The recently reconstituted Scottish National State Land Army along with our own Homeland Watch operatives should be able to keep the issue contained, and the people submissive until our goals can be achieved. "
SCT_destroy_traitors:0 "Arrest The Unionist Traitors"
SCT_destroy_traitors_desc:0 "The same roar goes out all over Glasgow and the Southwest of Scotland; ‘Round the bastards up!’ It seems that the Homeland Watch has come up with an innovative solution to the sectarian grievances in our country, rounding up the most radical of unionist and loyalist extremists, and putting them into special Watch administered prisons far out of Scotland’s major population centres."
SCT_red_scare:0 "Destroy The Red Clydeside Menace"
SCT_red_scare_desc:0 "John MacLean is a problematic figure. While he and his brand of Syndicalism are beloved by our people, we cannot allow their naivety to undermine our plans for National Renaissance. We must seek to undermine his legacy at every turn and expose the crimes committed by the Maximists against our people. Only then will the red menace never return to our shores. "
SCT_faith_unity:0 "Unity Through Faith"
SCT_faith_unity_desc:0 "While we are not a particularly sectarian movement, we accept that our own homegrown religion of Presbyterianism under Kirk should be one of the unifying factors of our country. Not only will this help placate the distrustful Unionist community, but it will also remind those Catholics who most supported Syndicalism who this country belongs to."
SCT_military_buildup:0 "Military Buildup"
SCT_military_buildup_desc:0 "How can we hope to preserve our newly found Independence and sense of purpose without the arms to defend it? The foremost focus of the National State government will be to repurpose old Union workshops for the benefit of Scottish arms manufacturing."
SCT_defence_contracts:0 "Defence Contracts"
SCT_defence_contracts_desc:0 "Sensing a void in the market, many international and some domestic companies have come flocking to our government with their wares. It seems we have no shortage of innovative enterprises from which to draw our national defence from."
SCT_build_forts:0 "A New Hadrian's Wall"
SCT_build_forts_desc:0 "If history has shown us anything, it’s that our wretched neighbours to the south will never leave us alone. Scotland will be defended until the bitter end, with watchtower, landmine, and bayonet. They will never again cross the tweed with impunity."
SCT_exploit_north_sea:0 "Exploit The North Sea"
SCT_exploit_north_sea_desc:0 "The rigs roar! For millennia, Scotland has been sitting on riches it could not yet previously fathom. The discovery of oil off the coast of Orkney, Shetland, and Aberdeenshire can be all things to all men. Let us export this resource as needed and build the mightiest military that our borders have ever seen."
SCT_promote_business:0 "Promote Scottish Business"
SCT_promote_business_desc:0 "As necessary as the National Rising was, it has utterly drained the Scottish economy. We cannot in good conscience prioritise arms funding at this moment in time. Scotland’s industry must be given time to heal, recover, develop, and grow before any such notions can be tabled."
SCT_scottish_houses:0 "Highland Town Initiative"
SCT_scottish_houses_desc:0 "The poverty inflicted upon us as part of the British Empire has been nothing short of staggering. Children in ragged clothes wander the tenement blocks of Govan and the Gorbals. While the Union of Britain launched social housing schemes, these were mostly focused around the cities. We will begin constructing new towns in the undeveloped countryside to bring prosperity to the people."
SCT_support_farmers:0 "The Crofter Question"
SCT_support_farmers_desc:0 "Scotland’s traditional crofters have always had a rotten deal. The clearances, the land war following the first Weltkreig. As we seek to rebuild Scotland, we must also rebuild Scotland’s lost Highland communities. We will ensure that the Lairds never return to the northern uplands, and that those who work the land, own the land."
SCT_mineral_mining:0 "Exploit Highland Minerals"
SCT_mineral_mining_desc:0 "Scotland had long been the powerhouse behind the British Empire, and the Union of Britain after. It is time that the natural resources of Scotland were turned over to benefit the Scottish people. It is our aim to open one new mine per month. Scotland will be reinvigorated by our natural bounty of coal and iron!"
SCT_permanent_stability:0 "Permanent Stability"
SCT_permanent_stability_desc:0 "While our reforms have proven immensely satisfactory, John MacCormick has decided that a few more decades of direct rule from the Homeland Watch is necessary to keep Scotland on the right path. As a result, we will transform the apparatus of the old Provisional Government into something far more permanent, for all true Scotsmen."
SCT_restore_democracy:0 "Restore Democracy"
SCT_restore_democracy_desc:0 "The Homeland Watch coup could never last forever, nor did we wish it to. Scotland is now enjoying the fruits of it’s Cultural Renaissance. New generations of our young now speak in the auld tongue, and the Scottish identity is now all but rebuilt. Let us turn Scotland back to the people, now that they can be trusted to safeguard our homeland."

SCT_gods_country:0 "One Union Under God"
SCT_gods_country_desc:0 "With the storming of Parliament Hall by our battle-hardened forces, we have shown the Scottish people that God’s firm hand is not to be trifled with. The decedent ideas of modernity shall be cast aside, we must usher in a new Covenant with God, as our forefathers did many centuries ago."
SCT_sword:0 "The Sword"
SCT_sword_desc:0 "What is Scotland without loyal Christian legions? A weak, powerless and defenceless cub.  No more the lamb of God, we shall become his lion, and Scotland’s legions will shake the earth on which they walk. They walk God's country and put our enemies to the holy sword."
SCT_religious_police:0 "Investigate The Papal Conspiracy"
SCT_religious_police_desc:0 "The agents of Rome continue to conspire against us. Everywhere a true blue blooded Scotsman turns, a Jesuit may be listening to his every word. We must root this out. Our sources tell us that the Papacy and the forces of the Internationale may very well be collaborating with Catholic Syndicalists to overthrow our regime. We shall toss their priests in prison and make them talk!"
SCT_crush_monarchists:0 "End The Unionist Menace"
SCT_crush_monarchists_desc:0 "The Unionists have proved useful for a time. Predominantly protestant, some have even supported our regime, hoping that we may at some point seek to reestablish the union. It is time to shatter their pathetic dreams."
SCT_shield:0 "The Shield"
SCT_shield_desc:0 "We are at the heart of a global revolution. Not the arrogant kind propagated by Syndicalists, and Liberals before them. No, we are on the cusp of something great, godly and good. The flame is, however, weak. We cannot allow our faith to be smothered in its crib. Holy Scotland will be defended."
SCT_oath_of_loyalty:0 "An Oath Of Loyalty"
SCT_oath_of_loyalty_desc:0 "To protect future generations from heresy we will ensure that all government and educational occupations require an oath to God and the State. Those who refuse will be put before the Lord's judgement."
SCT_christian_science:0 "A Protestant Education"
SCT_christian_science_desc:0 "We’ve shut down the Catholic schools. Barred anyone but practicing Presbyterians from higher education, and now we seek to raise our sons and daughters as the meek people of God that our creator had always intended. Ye, for today is a glorious day, from here on, Scotland will be run by only it’s most righteous, chosen sons."
SCT_purge_unfaithful:0 "Purge The Unfaithful"
SCT_purge_unfaithful_desc:0 "Atheists. Catholics. Episcopalians. Anglicans. These are the four enemies that Scotland must face if we wish to be a strong and unified nation, with the blessing and covenant of God. It is for God to judge them, but to send them to him is up to us. Without further ado, fellow Covenanters; Round them up!"
SCT_boris_johnson:0 "Disband Parliament"
SCT_boris_johnson_desc:0 "Of what good is a decedent and self-serving Scottish Parliament to our movement? How do Liberal, Syndicalist ideas of equality and democracy bring us closer to Christ? The Kirk Council of Elders has decided, it doesn’t. The building will be torn down for the arrogance it represents."
SCT_kirk_parliament:0 "The Kirk Assembly"
SCT_kirk_parliament_desc:0 "Disbanding parliament may be a foolish move. After all, a rubber stamp to legitimise our actions may come in exceptionally useful in cementing ourselves as a beacon of Protestant thought in the North Atlantic. The parliament should instead become an expanded Church of Scotland Council of Elders, only then will we steer the ship towards a more righteous future."
SCT_super_protestants:0 "Protestant Supremacy"
SCT_super_protestants_desc:0 "As we make haste to drive out the last of God’s enemies in Scotland, a new mood has made itself apparent the length and breadth of the country. Our people are at last once again taking pride in their correct and native religion. Scotland is truly witnessing a spiritual rebirth of the kind never seen before. Christ is King!"
SCT_new_people:0 "Covenanter Theology in one County"
SCT_new_people_desc:0 "Despite our newfound conviction in service to Christ the King, it is understood that we inhabit the 20th century. Scotland’s leader must be of flesh and blood in order to rally the people to the lamb of God. We will build our branch of Covenanter theology first in Scotland, and only then export our faith worldwide."
SCT_work_camps:0 "Faith Through Labour"
SCT_work_camps_desc:0 "The Rising was destructive, there is no debating this. Scotland’s economy has to recover before we can implement our radical and godly transformative program. Fortunately there is no shortage of our enemies who'd happily toil rather than be put to the sword."
SCT_work_ethic:0 "Protestant Work Ethic"
SCT_work_ethic_desc:0 "Given the prevalent notion of predestination in our national church, many true believers hold dear that to work hard is to show signs of being one of God’s chosen. As our grip on power continues to grow, these sentiments will too. It is only a matter of time before sloth is eradicated from this land and to do this we must promote the traditional protestant work ethic and expand the labour camps."
SCT_seize_lands:0 "Seize Catholic Lands"
SCT_seize_lands_desc:0 "Many centuries ago, the barbarians across the Scottish Sea flooded into our land after God punished their laziness with famine. Now they seek only to agitate and protest against a regime that puts Christ first. It is clear that these papists are nothing more than a nuisance, let us confiscate their property and turn it over to good Presbyterian men."
SCT_gods_kingdom:0 "God's Kingdom On Earth"
SCT_gods_kingdom_desc:0 "We must spread Covenanter Theology far and wide! Our oppressed brothers in Ulster and the rest of Ireland bear testament to what can happen when the God’s most faithful people are brought under the heel of papists and other enemies of Christ. Our Kingdom will not only be all encompassing, it will be righteous and Godly! Let us spread the message of Christ the King to all corners of the world!"
SCT_call_faithful:0 "A Call To The Faithful"
SCT_call_faithful_desc:0 "Up and down the country, Ministers loyal to the Covenanter movement are making our young men take a second oath to the Solemn League and Covenant. To forever be it’s defender in times of strife, and to act as missionary-soldiers in His Service. We are building an army to save mankind from itself, to bring all the world back into the light."
SCT_prussian_brothers:0 "Our Prussian Brothers"
SCT_prussian_brothers_desc:0 "We have much in common with our Protestant brethren in northern Germany. We should be thankful that Prussia is ruled by a joint church of Calvinists and Lutherans. While we consider Lutheranism merely another unreformed faith, there are those industrialists in Germany who follow the correct Calvinist path. We will consult with them for economic aid between two anti-papal powers."
SCT_silver_legion:0 "Sons Of The Legion"
SCT_silver_legion_desc:0 "Everywhere in Scotland, the legions continue to grow. What was once the paramilitary wing of the Covenanter Movement, has become a mighty army indeed. And such a mighty army needs arms to fight. We shall reach across the Atlantic to our brothers in faith and let us pray that the Silver Legion sees the light and become our newest benefactor."
SCT_gods_light:0 "In God's Holy Light"
SCT_gods_light_desc:0 "A covenant remade and restored. A people turned back to the right path. All Scotsmen now read from the same Hymn sheet. Christ the King can be heard chanted in streets everywhere in Scotland. Truly, we will witness his second coming soon, and by the grace of God, truly be his chosen people. "

SCT_jacobite_king:0 "Rupprecht Sits atop Stone of Destiny"
SCT_jacobite_king_desc:0 "With it was with help from our gallant allies in Europe that we managed to liberate ourselves from Syndicalist British tyranny. Now it is time for us to show our appreciation. In order to further our ties with the emerging German power in Europe, we seek to crown Rupprecht of Bavaria as King of Scots. Long live King Robert IV of House Stuart-Wittelsbach, forever may a descendent of the Bruce occupy our throne!"

SCT_socialist_legacy:0 "Maclean's Legacy Lives On"
SCT_socialist_legacy_desc:0 "John MacLean was seen as Scotland’s saviour. In a time mired by civil strife, economic depression, and the molestation of the Scottish Proletariat by an Anglo-Scots Bourgeoise, it was John MacLean who walked through Clydeside with the red banner in his hand, rallying the people to socialism and better lives. Against all demagogues, Liberals, and dictators, Scotland will truly be an uncorrupted worker’s state again."
SCT_highland_campaign:0 "Begin The Highland Campaign"
SCT_highland_campaign_desc:0 "After our successful revolution we were able to banish both Mosley and his goons along with the reactionaries. Unfortunately the latter still persist and harass our rule from secret bases in the Highlands. If we are to ever truly liberate Scotland they must be destroyed."
SCT_destroy_watch:0 "Destroy The Watch"
SCT_destroy_watch_desc:0 "The Homeland Watch is a nest of reactionary vipers who have been opposed to our rule since its very inception. When Scotland broke free all the poisonous reactionary elements rallied behind MacCormick and his band of thugs. It is time to end them once and for all."
SCT_root_out_unionists:0 "Root Out Unionists"
SCT_root_out_unionists_desc:0 "The red flag flies over Glasgow city hall. Legion’s of working men and women descend on Unionist neighbourhoods. Tonight is the night that we end Scotland’s bourgeois religious divide. No longer will Catholics work in poor conditions, nor any Scotsman!"
SCT_secular_state:0 "A Secular State"
SCT_secular_state_desc:0 "Scotland is a land of many religions and faiths and this leads to a bitter sectarian divide, especially between the protestants and the catholic minority. Rather than a pick a side in this fight we will instead declare a state of secularity. No religion shall be favoured and all will be free to follow their own faith or lack thereof."
SCT_communard_spirit:0 "The Spirit Of Maclean"

SCT_socialist_science:0 "A Socialist Education"
SCT_socialist_science_desc:0 "Fortunately for us much of the old education system that was under the Union of Britain has remained intact.

SCT_scottish_tuc:0 "A Scottish TUC"
SCT_scottish_tuc_desc:0 "The Trade Union’s Congress was the cornerstone of British democracy before the tyrant Mosley packed it full of his goons. The idea, however, is not flawed. A Scottish TUC will serve the interests of Scotland’s Proletariat better than any bourgeois parliament ever could!"
SCT_punish:0 "Punish The Totalists"
SCT_punish_desc:0 "It was they who destroyed the legacy of MacLean, it was they who made a national rising inevitable, and it was they who allowed the forces of reaction to taint the progressive forces of Socialism in these isles. The Totalists must be brought to trial and pay for what they have done to MacLean’s legacy."
SCT_compromise_with_totalists:0 "Compromise With The Totalists"
SCT_compromise_with_totalists_desc:0 "Is it perhaps the case that our Proletarian brother’s across Scotland and Britain were merely led astray by Mosley and his band of traitors?

SCT_the_dream_desc:0 "The Union of Britain never truly represented Scotland’s workers. Committees stuffed with English and Welsh working men is all well and good, but at last Scotland’s workers truly have a state of their own, and the apparatus of local government to ensure that the snake of Imperialism, be it revisionism from our allies or a power across the sea, never touches our shores again."

SCT_revive_culture:0 "Revive Scottish Culture"
SCT_revive_culture_desc:0 "A defining characteristic of the Lowland Scot is his loyalty. The unionists are jubilant, and the nationalists uneasy.

SCT_accomodate_unionists:0 "Accommodate Unionists"
SCT_accomodate_unionists_desc:0 "Scotland’s Unionists have endured some tough times. The revolution saw the proscription of Unionist fraternal organisations and the suppression of Protestant churches, and the rising made them feel more distant from their British brethren than ever. They must know that they are at last, safe."
SCT_purge_syndies:0 "Arrest Leftist Agitators"
SCT_purge_syndies_desc:0 "It was the Syndicalists who facilitated the fall of one of the world’s most successful political unions. They must be punished for their treachery. Loyal men will drag the ‘intellectuals’ of Clydeside from their beds tonight."
SCT_parliament_question: "The Question Of Parliament"
SCT_parliament_question_desc:0 "Who should hold supreme power in Scotland? A nation still besieged by republican, separatist, and syndicalist influences cannot stand.

SCT_iedc_aid:0 "IEDC Aid"
SCT_iedc_aid_desc:0 "The Imperial Economic Development Corporation is an integral part in keeping the Empire not only prosperous, but also united in purpose.

SCT_border_forts:0 "Fortify The Border"
SCT_border_forts_desc:0 "The regime to the south of Scotland claims to be British, but they hold none of the values that made our nation so great. The precious foothold that Great Britain has in Scotland cannot be relinquished. They will not cross the border."

SCT_raise_loyal_militia_desc:0 "The reclamation is coming. All over Glasgow and the central belt, Loyal men, once brainwashed and suppressed by both Syndicalists and Nationalists, now flock to the banner of the Union.

SCT_silence_nats:0 "Silence The Nationalists"
SCT_silence_nats_desc:0 "The radical McLeod could have been useful to Britain in another life, but the reality remains, his movement is nothing but a source of religious and nationalist agitation. As for MacCormick, he should have been put to the noose many years ago. We will end both movements by cutting off the head of the snake and watching the body die."
SCT_governor_powers:0 "Establish The Governor's Powers"
SCT_governor_powers_desc:0 "Until we retake Britain, an appointed and somewhat authoritarian governor rules over Scotland. A necessary and unfortunate evil. A petition has reached his desk calling for democratic reform to show the good, loyal British men to the south that we will forever uphold British values. On the contrary, elements within the military and nobility believe this is just a scheme by the nationalists and that the status quo must be maintained."
SCT_prepare_integration:0 "Prepare For Integration"

SCT_farming_grants:0 "Farming Grants"
SCT_farming_grants_desc:0 "Scotland’s freeholders have suffered under botched, heavy handed Syndicalist rule.

SCT_kings_party:0 "A True Scottish Party"
SCT_kings_party_desc:0 "The Conservative and Unionist Party currently stands dominant in parliament. The CUP is a true Scottish party like no other.

SCT_age_of_rail:0 "An Age Of Rail"
SCT_age_of_rail_desc:0 "One of the chief victories of syndicalism is the abolition of private transport. From London, to Paris, to Torino, trains are the transport of the working man. Let us bring this age of rail to Scotland and bring working men from Edinburgh to Glasgow closer together!"

SCT_syndie_army_desc:0 "In 1925, the revolution was not won by some officers corp that studied miles away with no connection to their soldiers!

SCT_empower_trade_unions:0 "Empower Trade Unions"
SCT_empower_trade_unions_desc:0 "The true hallmark of a syndicalist economy is it's trade unions. It can be said that the liberty of a people is measured by the power of their unions, and as such we must grant the trade unions more privileges and power within the government."

scotland.1.t:0 "Assessing The Economy"
scotland.1.d:0 "With Scotland being thrust into independence, it is safe to say that our economy is still young, stagnating and without direction. While the government has authorized plans to get the economy somewhat moving we will have to decide what direction to take. Some in the government argue we should look to the example set by the Crofters and Scotland's agrarian past. Our population is not big and making Scotland the breadbasket of the aisles would certainly alleviate this issue. However, others argue we should steer the economy towards industrialization."

sctflavor.1.t:0 "Debates within the Seanadh"
sctflavor.1.d:0 "Today there has been a debate in the Seanadh regarding the future of the nation. The debate touched on many issues ranging from economic policy to policy both foreign and domestic. As a young nation many questions still needed answering after all. One of the questions that was touched last was what form would Scotland’s government take. While the Provisional Republic under John MacCormick has done fine, Scotland traditionally had a King, and many within the Seanadh such as Sir Compton Mackenzie support a restoration. However the long centuries of British dominion and the rising Republican tendencies brought about by the Syndicalist takeover in the 1920s has left many Scots with a disdain for monarchs and monarchy. As the debate raged the suggestion was made that the Provisional Republic be made permanent and in response an unknown member of the Seanadh in apparent frustration at MacCormick called out “No, It will be a kingdom and John MacCormick will be our King!” This brought a cascade of snickering from the body and soon, MacCormick had become known as 'King John'. Despite a being a republican, MacCormick has entirely embraced the nickname, saying that he finds it rather amusing."
sctflavor.1.a:0 "God Save King John..?"

sctflavor.2.t:0 "The Second Neo-Jacobite Revival"
sctflavor.2.d:0 "In the years before the First Weltkrieg the UK played host to a mild Jacobite revival. Many Scots, looking back on their history for famous Scots of recent times, focused on the Stuarts and especially Bonnie Prince Charlie. Many poems and societies were founded supporting the Jacobite cause and the surge even caused some mild consternation in London. However during Weltkrieg the main Jacobite claimant, Rupprecht of Bavaria appeared on the front fighting for the German Kaiser, then came the Revolution. The two occurrences aborted any real lasting Jacobite revival. Many of the remaining post-Weltkrieg Jacobites were largely right wing and fled the United Kingdom as the Syndicalists bowled over any opposition. However with Scotland free and its future up in the air the Jacobites seemingly have returned. Many Scots are rallying behind Scottish heroes and Charles Stuart has become one of them. Jacobite regiments are forming in the Army, some members of the Seanadh have openly discussed inviting the Stuarts to the throne and a cavalcade of societies dedicated to the Jacobite cause have sprung up. The most important and largest of them is the Society of the White Rose, the successor to the Order of the White Rose formed before the Weltkrieg. Founded by English writer Herbert Vivan and Scotsman Ruaraidh Erskine the Society has gone further than the Order ever did. While the Order largely contained itself to promote Jacobitism in the arts, The Society has begun to promote it in the political arena as well. The Whirlwind, a newpaper created by the two in 1890 has resumed publication and the Society’s members have been encouraged to join the government at every level. But the Society isn't the only force pushing for a Jacobite restoration, the NSP's own Compton Mackenzie has expressed his belief in the legitimacy of the House of Stuart. An English born author with English parents, Mackenzie wouldn't seem like a true scot at first however he has gone to great lengths to retrace his ancestry back to his spiritual home in the Highlands. His efforts of working for Scottish Independence with him being a co-founder of the NSP have earned him the respect of many, and with a well respected Jacobite in the NSP the idea of a restoration seems less out of reach by the day."
sctflavor.2.a:0 "Jacobites eh? What an archaic lot, let's hope they don't cause trouble."

sctflavor.3.t:0 "The SILP Boycotts the Government!"
sctflavor.3.d:0 "Today in a speech delivered before the Seanadh James Maxton has announced his Scottish Independent Labour Party or SILP, will not be cooperating with the government from here on. This has come about due to rising worries that with the NSP dominating the Seanadh and John MacCormick dominating the NSP, MacCormick may set himself up as President for life. Maxton decried the STUC for ‘class collaboration’ by continuing to work with the NSP and when an elder member of the NSP made a largely incoherent speech to the Seanadh in response, Maxton shouted back ‘Sit down man, you’re a bloody tragedy’. This is a hard blow to the NSP’s attempt at an informal government of national unity. Maxon is a very prominent left wing politician and a holdover from the days of Windsor domination. After the Revolution Maxon remained with the increasingly insipid Labour Party. However, as Labour fell more and more into the political waste bin of history, Maxon split off. Taking a sizable portion of Labour's Scottish voting base with him he formed the Scottish Independent Labour Party. Billed as the Second Labour Party by its critics and the New Labour by its admirers, the SILP quickly grew to dominate the industrial lowlands of Scotland. Since the outbreak of the War of Independence the SILP has largely remained quiet, keeping its cards close to its chest as Maxon weighed what to do next. Now however he has played his hand and who's to say if MacCormick can beat it."

sctrevolt.1.t:0 "The Provisional Seanadh is Formed"
sctrevolt.1.d:0 "Gu ma fada beò Alba bhàn! Ever since the tyrant Mosely attempted to take full control of the Union British rule over Scotland has weakened considerably. This, combined with rising nationalism stoked by Syndicalist portentions to ‘Self-Rule’ have caused a perfect storm. The storm broke some weeks ago when Scottish nationalists stormed the city hall of Inverness and tore down the Red Banner, raising the Cross of St Andrew in its stead. Syndicalist troops in the city were caught off guard and after mass defections of their Scottish ‘comrades’ were forced from the area. Situations much like this played out across Scotland over the next two weeks and it wasn’t long before the scattered revolts coalesced into a genuine war for independence. Today in Inverness representatives from across the newly liberated land have gathered, forming the Provisional Seanadh as the nation's ruling body for the duration of the war with England. Riding the wave of euphoria brought on by freedom for the first time in centuries, people on the street are talking about the war lasting weeks if not days. However military experts and the nascent Scottish Army itself is keenly aware of just how much of an uphill battle the coming campaign will be. Even with Wales following Scotland into revolt the British Army is a beast to be feared. For Scotland to finally be well and truly free once more it will take skill, determination, perseverance and gallons of blood."
sctrevolt.1.a:0 "Alba gu bràth!"

sctrevolt.2.t:0 "John MacCormick elected Provisional President"
sctrevolt.2.d:0 "As the battle lines are drawn in the fields of the Lowlands and the Scottish Army prepares to defend their homes from British incursion, their homes are simultaneously being put in order. The members of the Seanadh have quickly begun to form new parties to push their own political agendas. To the far right are the Scottish Protestant League led by Reverend John White. As a band of Protestant fanatics their hatred of all things Angelican, Catholic and Episcopalian, along with all other human vices, has quickly relegated them to the minority of a minority. Also on the far right is the Paladin League, an even more fringe movement led by their only Seanadh member Graham Seton Hutchison calling for a return of the clan system as a basis of a classless, corporatist Scotland, arguing the Scots represent a unique race. Meanwhile on the far left the remnant Syndicalists, the Scottish Trade Union Council, have rallied under Willie Gallacher seeking a return of Syndicalist rule to Scotland.However they don't want rule from London but from Edinburgh. Most of the delegates however have consolidated under the National Party of Scotland or NSP. As a broad coalition of nationalists the NSP has roped in nationalists from all sides to form a strong party whose only goal for the moment is seeing Scotland freed from its British shackles. However with the NSP being a loose coalition of nationalists, many are already worrying over a potential split in the party after the war with England is over. The NSP, now dominating the Seanadh, has elected its new leader John MacCormick as President of the Seanadh and President of the Provisional Scottish Republic, despite contentions from STUC and the Left wing faction in the NSP. John MacCormick is a lawyer by trade but in his free time he has become an avid Scottish nationalist. After deciding against fleeing England with the Exiles on the outbreak of the Revolution, John made it his life’s work to get Scotland as much autonomy as he could under the Syndicalists. It was through his strenuous efforts, and the combined exertions of thousands of men just like him, that Scotland was granted a devolved Union Congress just a few years after the Revolution. Now, standing in the chamber of the body he helped build, he solemnly takes the oath of office. Upon him are not only the eyes of all of Scotland, or the eyes of all of the British Isles, but the eyes of the world."

sctrevolt.3.t:0 "Gallacher Protests Against MacCormick"
sctrevolt.3.d:0 "President MacCormick has not even had the luxury of finishing unpacking his new office when the first blow against his administration has been struck. Today in the Seanadh Willie Gallacher has taken the floor as the Minority Leader to decry the election of MacCormick. He has denounced the election as a scam, a fraud and blatant corruption and nepotism. He said the dominance of the NSP is unfair and that the Syndicalists were unable to get so much as a word in before MacCormick was sworn in. The NSP was quick to come to the President’s aid however. Firstly the Majority Leader, Eric Linklater started out his rebuttal by thanking MacCormick for taking the job as Provisional President. He then urged all delegates to hold their objections until the War was over. Stressing the need for unity and singularity of purpose in the face of the English foe he was met by a roaring applause from NSP delegates. Instead the Syndicalists and even the SPL sat in stoic silence, brooding over their rebuke."

sctrevolt.14.t:0 "Aid our Scottish Brothers?" (For the Irish)
sctrevolt.14.d:0 "Surprising news has filtered out of the Union of Britain. Namely that the Union is no more. With Lawrence and his clique distracted by keeping a firm grip on England itself Scotland has seemingly found its chance. For the first time since 1745 Scottish and English troops clash on the fields of Britain once more. So far its anybody’s guess just how the war will end. This sudden turn of events has energized the Gaelic revivalists within our nation. They want us to aid our Gaelic brothers in Scotland in their war. While the government is firm in its decision not to intervene directly, we still have warehouses of old British equipment from the First Weltkrieg. Not only that but we already have reports of volunteer regiments gathering to head off to Scotland. To the jingoists in our administration our hand has been forced. They claim we must sanction the volunteers and send them our guns as well. However the peace faction has continued their own campaign. They say let the volunteers go and die for their ideals. Meanwhile the guns will be put to better use defending our fair isle against any future British incursion."

sctrevolt.15.t:0 "The Irish send Guns and Men!"
sctrevolt.15.d:0 "The crowd gathers at the docks of Portpatrick to greet a most unexpected sight. In port today is the Eire, an Irish cargo ship. However, the cargo it is disgorging is totally different from the consumer goods it once held. Instead ramshackle gangplanks allow hundreds of Irishmen to disembark from their perilous journey through the British naval blockade. Along with them come crate after crate of guns and ammo. While the guns date from before the First Weltkrieg in some instances, to a nation sorely lacking weaponry any gun is a godsend. Not only has weaponry and men been sent but ammo as well. Millions of rounds of ammunition for all the guns in the crates have also begun to be unloaded. The Irish Volunteers were quickly organized into the brand new Volunteer Corps, a new corps whose sole command is over any and all regiments of foreign fighters who may come to our shores and aid us in our fight for freedom. Most of the men who have arrived are Scots-Irish from Ulster. While some figure this conflict is being used as training in preparation for a full scale revolt in Ireland by Ulster, few Scots care to care. Instead these brave men and their shining new guns are already on the march towards the Front and their glorious destiny."
sctrevolt.15.a:0 "Send our thanks to Irish Government!"

sctrevolt.4.t:0 "The Exiles from Canada Arrive"
sctrevolt.4.d:0 "As our revolt thunders on we have begun to get a steady stream of foreign volunteers. Some are foreigners who want to fight for us for some reason or another, others are of the Scottish diaspora who are returning home to see their land freed forever more. The most curious band of volunteers has been the so-called Canuck Scots. These men and women were Scots who fled to Canada with King Edward after the Revolution. Now that Scotland is free from Syndicalist and more importantly British tyranny, these Canuck Scots have decided to abandon their previous loyalties. They swear no allegiance to the King in Ottawa and instead reaffirm their ancestral ties to the land they hold so dear. Many of these men have valuable conflict experience fighting in the Weltkrieg or one of the Entente’s scattered colonial conflicts, so their aid is most welcome."
sctrevolt.4.a:0 "Welcome Home!"

sctrevolt.5.t:0 "The Exiles Rally Around the Scottish and Unionist Parties"
sctrevolt.5.d:0 "As more and more Exiles return from Canada some of them who claimed to have revoked their love of the Windsors have plainly lied. This was made obvious when The Scottish Unionist Association announced its reformation and intention to seek office. Made up entirely of Exiles the Unionists are an explicitly pro-Monarchist and pro-Windsor party whose only goal is to return Scotland into the United Kingdom, effectively turning Scotland into the foothold Canada has so desperately desired on the British Isles. Our security forces have already intercepted some Canadian agitators attempting to smuggle themselves into Scotland with orders to support the Unionists. While we cannot yet be sure if this is just a one off attempt at influencing us or just the first snag in a massive web of corruption, this event alone is not enough to crack down on the Unionists. Besides, they have officially denounced the agitators in a statement... broadcasted by the Canadian Broadcasting Company. Nevertheless their influence continues to grow. However some exiles and even Scots who stayed after the revolution have rallied around the Scottish Party. Led by Duke James Graham, the party wishes for Scotland to return to British protection, but unlike the Unionists who merely wish for a return of the pre-revolution status quo the Scottish Party calls for establishment of a Dominion Scottish Parliament within the British Empire. What this would truly mean for Scotland is ambiguous at best, despite this the Scottish Party has declared their hope to seek office."

sctrevolt.6.t:0 "Request Aid from the King in Ottawa?"
sctrevolt.6.d:0 "While we have yet to lose the ongoing war, we certainly have yet to win it. The plain fact that we simply cannot survive a protracted war is plain to anybody who cares to look. As the situation creeps towards critical we have begun to think of the unthinkable to win the war. One of those unthinkable options is to turn to the Canadians for help. Since our rebellion the Entente has been biting at the bit to intervene on our behalf as a jumpstart to their reclamation of the Home Islands. This has obviously been championed by the Unionists who openly pray for a restoration of Windsor rule. They claim that not only would Canadian help be extremely valuable to winning the War but it would also open the door to the ‘Second Glorious Revolution’ that would bring the Windsors back from their ignoble exile. Even those who hate the Windsors admit that having a strong alliance like the Entente at our backs would be extremely useful. However, for every person in favor of the outreach there are two who oppose it. The reasons are plain. There is no love lost for the Windsors in this new Scotland and the Canadians will no doubt leverage their assistance to use us for their own designs. The choice before us is an unenviable one, but one that must be made nonetheless."

sctrevolt.7.t:0 "The Scots Request Aid"
sctrevolt.7.d:0 "Today a most surprising telegram has arrived from Scotland. The region is apparently in revolt from the Syndicalists or whoever is in control of London. They are asking for our help in fighting off the Syndicalists. They have specifically asked for the Black Watch, the most famous Scottish regiment still in the British Army, to be sent to fight. This is a unique opportunity to jumpstart our reclamation of the Home Isles. If we do send help and it proves critical in the Scots victory we would be given a superb bargaining chip. With Scotland under our thumb the reclamation of England and Wales would be near trivial. Sure Scotland may want ‘autonomy’ or even freedom, but we forced them into the fold once before and we can do it again. However, some of the cautious among our administration have spoken against this. They say that if we do send the Black Watch and the Scots still lose we would risk the annihilation of one of the most veteran units in our Army. They point out that preparations for Operation Homecoming are going along nicely irregardless of the developing situation in Scotland. Not only that but Scotland was a hub of Syndicalist revolt during the Revolution and the current Scottish regime has gone on record denying any hopes for a Windsor revival.."

sctrevolt.8.d:0 "Today in Inverness a grand ceremony has been conducted. As ships flying the Union Jack docked in port the band on land began playing Over the Hills and Far Away. Over the next few hours the Black Watch set foot in Scotland for the first time in nearly two decades. For some it was an emotional homecoming as they met family long thought lost. For others it was a more solemn experience as they witnessed their homeland having moved on without them. All men expressed conflicting feelings to both the King they still swore loyalty to and their homeland that now fought for its freedom from the hated Red Menace but the King they served. In the end however, as loyal soldiers of the British Army, they followed orders. Their commander Sir Archibald Cameron accepted a temporary commission into the Scottish Army on behalf of himself and the entire regiment. They then received their new orders and began their march to the Front. As the men marched South into battle their logistical corps began to rapidly unload the rest of the Canadian aid. Thousands of crates of guns, more thousands of crates and enough rations and bandages to supply an army twice the size of Scotland’s for several weeks. While the government is truly grateful for the aid, an uneasy feeling pervades the halls of power in Edinburgh. Canada has now been given tremendous leverage over the future of Scotland and few have any doubts as to what their demands may be."

While giving Canada such a massive say in Scotland’s future would have been a hurdle, Scotland having a future at all was preferable. With the war continuing and Scotland inching ever closer to the brink of disaster, that future seems ever closer to slipping through his fingers."

sctrevolt.10.d:0 "With the Canadians being of no use the President has been forced to look on the other side of the coin. In Berlin the Kaiser sits triumphant over Europe. His Army rolled over the Entente after nearly six years of bloody conflict. Since its victory the German Army has only grown in professionalism and ability. Our Army has done much to learn from battle but the German Army has leagues more experience. Even just a few advisors would do wonders to turn our army from a band of ragtag militia into a true military force. However opposition to the Kaiser is just as fierce as it is to the Windsors. Our opponents decry it as just giving our state to the other major monarch. Not only that, but the monarch in question is German! The horrors of the Weltkrieg have soured many Scotsmen and women to the Germans as a people, its only obvious that they would simply refuse to serve a German officer or even monarch. By supporting us in the war the Germans would gain a decisive edge over us and having a close ally on the British isles is too good to pass up, with many fearing them demanding we enthrone the House of Wittelsbach as they are technically some of the most senior claimants to the Scottish Throne. When, not if but when, the Germans go to war with the Syndicalists Scotland would once more be a battleground, this time not even in a war of its choosing!"
sctrevolt.10.a:0 "We don't need help from some stick up his arse Kraut!"
sctrevolt.10.b:0 "Send the request, the help is needed."

sctrevolt.11.t:0 "The Scottish Want Help"
sctrevolt.11.d:0 "Today a peculiar message has reached Berlin. It comes from Edinburgh which recently has risen in revolt from the Syndicalist dogs. The Scottish situation has been closely monitored by the Abwher for some time now and we were hoping to find some way to use it to our advantage, but this is simply too good to pass up. The Scottish are asking for our help in their war against the English. They are asking for men, guns and supplies, something we have in spades. The value of such a deal is plain for everybody to see. By endearing Scotland to us we can bring them into the Reichspost, and even potentially get the King of Bavaria, Rupprecht crowned as the King of Scotland. That would tie Scotland to us for all time and give the German Army a useful base to attack the Syndicalists on the isles. At the very least it will serve as a useful diversion and keep British troops out of France while we crush the frogs in the coming war. Opponents to the plan however point out that with Russia and France growing in power on our border, our military will be hard pressed in fending them both off when war comes. Besides, a majority of all military production is used almost the moment it rolls off the factory line. What few supplies we can set aside for storage are more better used defending fair Germania, not galavanting in the cold hellscape that is Scotland. None of this mentions just how expensive such an endeavor would be as well."
sctrevolt.11.a:0 "Of course we'll support their fight against Syndicalism!"
sctrevolt.11.b:0 "We simply can't afford it right now."

sctrevolt.12.t:0 "German Aid Arrives!"
sctrevolt.12.d:0 "Today the Schottisches Expeditionsregiment has arrived in Northern Scotland. Made up of the best soldiers Germany can spare they have been met with a lukewarm reception from the locals. Those who fought in the First Weltkrieg actively shun or harass them while the rest of the Scots give them wary glances. However, the German soldiers are more focused on doing their job. Intercepted letters home have already shown they do not like the colder climate in northern Scotland. However while men may whine and complain, weapons do not. Kar 98s have begun to be unloaded from the many ships that forced their way through the English blockade. Their iconic bark has quickly followed them to the battlefields. At the same time tons of medicine from Bayer has also begun to be sent to field hospitals near the Front. With these more modern rifles and excess of medicine, along with the injection of a core of professionalism brought by the Germans, the Army’s sagging morale has begun a noticeable tick upwards. The kindness shown by the Kaiser has also begun to slowly change attitudes to the Germans as well. While people are far from trusting the Germans, their help has softened attitudes to a minor extent."
sctrevolt.12.a:0 "Send our thanks to the Kaiser!"

sctrevolt.13.t:0 "The Kaiser Refuses our Plea!"
sctrevolt.13.d:0 "After an agonizing wait, an even more agonizing response has reached Edinburgh. The Germans have turned their backs on us. Whether due to cost, logistics, want or a combination of the three, no help is on the horizon. The news has been met with despair by the people and by the government. The people are rapidly tiring of the see-saw battles and the grinding frontline movements. They had been promised that the war would be quick and Perfidious Albion will be sent back to her hovel with a sharp crack across the face. This has plainly not happened and public morale has begun to reach new lows. Meanwhile in the halls of government where the big picture is clearer spirits are indeed higher than on the streets, but not by much. The Army fights as ferociously as they did yesterday, with or without German guns. Indeed some analysts even predict our ultimate victory. However, the nagging worries that have dogged our leaders since the opening days of our rebellion have grown into burdens. They walk with hunched shoulders, bagged eyes and worried glances. The President has reportedly spent two days without sleep after receiving the news, spending most of his  time muttering about what to do next."
sctrevolt.13.a:0 "Jerry Bastards!"

sctrevolt.16.t:0 "Reaching out to the Syndicalists?"
sctrevolt.16.d:0 "With all other avenues for aid having come and gone the government has finally turned to a truly radical direction. The Syndicalists in the Seanadh have until now largely remained uncooperative with the Government. Many of them want Scotland free, but free and under the Red Banner. Some of the more radical bootlickers even want a return to British domination. Despite their public face, their leader Willie Gallacher has made secret overtures to the President in the past. However he has also made some serious demands in return for his help. First and foremost he wants all Syndicalist units to be led and commanded by a parallel Syndicalist power structure in the Army. Not only that but he has a bullet pointed list of dozens of demands for reforms he wants to be undertaken. While many in our government have no love for Syndicalism, and more than a few have what can be best described as a hatred for it, as the times grow ever tougher its becoming ever more clear that we may have no other choice."
sctrevolt.16.a:0 "It's their fault for not cooperating! No agreements!"
sctrevolt.16.b:0 "We have no choice, reach out to Gallacher."

sctrevolt.17.t:0 "Gallacher demands MacCormick's Resignation!"
sctrevolt.17.d:0 "Today in the midst of another round of negotiations between Willie Gallacher and the NSP led by John MacCormick, Gallacher made a stunning demand. He demanded MacCormick resign as President. He explained that the President is a known opponent to Syndicalism and ‘agent of the bourgeois’ and that he couldn’t in good conscious work with a class traitor. This immediately led to a screaming match between NSP and Syndicalist delegates both of whom refused to budge. After an hour of nothing getting done, Gallacher led the Syndicalists in walking out of negotiations. While MacCormick is hesitant about resigning, considering that if he does Gallacher will no doubt attempt to take over after him, he is also a Scottish patriot. His more left leaning advisors are telling him to do what is right for Scotland and at least give resignation a thought. With the Syndicalists in government Scotland would have a better chance of survival. Moderates in the government however have crafted a compromise that they think Gallacher would accept. They want to offer Gallacher half of the Cabinet. He can choose whoever he wants to sit in those seats and it will give the Syndicalists a say in government. However, MacCormick won't resign and the Syndicalist militia would instead be folded into the regular Army structure. This compromise was immediately countered by the conservatives and traditionalists in MacCormick’s cabinet. They demand that MacCormick not bow to the Syndicalists demands but he should retaliate by arresting Syndicalist leaders. They have long suspected Gallacher and his men of being English sympathizers and this demand has seemingly been the proof they have been searching for."
sctrevolt.17.a:0 "Tell him to shove it!"
sctrevolt.17.b:0 "Offer a compromise."
sctrevolt.17.c:0 "We don't have a choice, accept the demands."

sctrevolt.18.t:0 "The Red Wave"
sctrevolt.18.d:0 "Gallacher has seemingly not taken his rejection well. After receiving word that the offer was rejected, Gallacher has let loose his dogs. The radical elements within the Syndicalist movement have apparently been planning a coup for some time, Gallacher was the only one holding them back. With him having let them go, they moved quickly. As dawn rose today over Edinburgh Scots awoke to find soldiers flying the Red Banner occupying key crossroads across the city. Their assault on the radio station however was delayed by an hour due to the militia commander philandering and by the time they got to the building local SPL members had rallied enough men to fight them off long enough for the Army to come in and finally smash them. With the radio station still in government hands the coup was revealed to the world and regular Army units began to rush to the city. Despite this early success President MacCormick has seemingly been paralyzed with indecision. What few left leaning advisors remain with him have been begging him to give into Gallacher’s demand for control and spare Scotland a dooming civil war. Meanwhile his right wing allies have been begging equally as hard for him to give the Army the go ahead to clear the barricades. The Syndicalists are still vulnerable and have yet to set up true and strong defenses. If the Army moves now they could rather easily sweep the streets and crush the revolt. After agonizing hours of debate the call goes out and the radio waves echo with a history defining message."
sctrevolt.18.a:0 "John MacCormick has announced his resignation…."
sctrevolt.18.b:0 "Today the Army has announced offensive operations in Edinburgh…"

sctrevolt.20.t:0 "MacCormick Stands Alone"
sctrevolt.20.d:0 "After hours of intense skirmishing and dozens of dead on both sides, the frantic tide of battle has washed over the Syndicalists. Their barricades lay broken on the street, their men are dead, captured or fleeing for their lives and the Red Banner has been consigned to the waste bin of history. Their leaders have abandoned them and have been reportedly seen fleeing South to the English lines. The Red Wave has crashed upon Scotland’s shores and has been broken. MacCormick, riding a wave of massive popular support, has received calls from what Syndicalist delegates remain in the Seanadh. All of them, to a man, have basically fallen over themselves in an attempt to save their skins. They have disavowed Gallacher and his crew and have pledged eternal loyalty to Scotland and to the man who saved it, John MacCormick. Meanwhile the right, always eager to see the left get smashed, have sung McCormicks praises and in a sermon today Rev John White, leader of the SPL and head of the Rightist faction with actual representation the Seanadh, urged his allies and devotees to follow MacCormick. With his rule over the NSP as secure as ever it's become clear that John MacCormick now has complete and uncontested control over Scotland. The only question now is what he shall do with this newfound power?"
sctrevolt.20.a:0 "We could never have seen how deep the infiltration has gone until now, declare a state of emergency!"
sctrevolt.20.b:0 "Simply ban Syndicalism from the Seanadh! We cannot slip into autocracy!"

sctrevolt.19.t:0 "The New Provisional Government"
sctrevolt.19.d:0 "Today, in a stunning speech that brought all those in attendance (except for the Syndicalists) to tears, John MacCormick announced his sudden retirement from the office of President of the Seanadh effective immediately. In his wake Willie Gallacher rose to speak. In his speech he thanked John MacCormick for his service to the nation and called for the Seanadh to convene for the day out of respect. Gallacher’s real intentions were clear to all those within the web of politics however. Ever since the conclusion of the negotiations with the NSP weeks ago Galalcher had been in secret talks with the laborite wing of the Party. Those talks were nearly complete with the laborites only waiting for MacCormick to actually resign. Now that he has, Gallacher wanted to finish the talks and secure his position at the head of the new Scottish government. This play was made the next day. Immediately after the opening of the Seanadh Douglas Young, unofficial leader of the left wing of the NSP, rose to propose a vote on the next President of the body. The NSP dutifully put it's own man Oliver Brown in the running but, totally expectedly, he fell short of the 3/4ths majority needed to confirm a new President. The second candidate to be voted for was Willie Gallacher. The Syndicalists, who had gained a few new converts since the talks began, all voted for him of course but that still left him short a few dozen votes. However, again totally expectedly, Young then led his clique in voting for Gallacher. With that Willie Gallacher was named the Second President of the Seanad and Scotland."
sctrevolt.19.a:0 "The Flame of Syndicalism can never go out, only dim."

sctrevolt.21.t:0 "The Scottish Unity Government"
sctrevolt.21.d:0 "After days of intense closed door meetings Willie Gallacher, leader of the STUC and President John MacCormick have made a startling joint announcement. They have announced the formation of the Scottish Unity Government for the duration of the War. The two have said they have signed the agreement due to a love of Scotland rather than any real political similarities. The terms of the agreement are, like all compromises, a bit of give and take for both sides. The Syndicalists get the option to choose the appointments for half of the Cabinet seats and the NSP has pledged to take up many issues that are core planks of the Syndicalist platform like work reform. Not only that but MacCormick and most of the leadership of the NSP signed a pledge not to ban Syndicalism or infringe on the Party’s natural and inalienable rights. In return Gallacher has agreed that the Syndicalist militia he will send to the front will be rolled into the regular Army higher command rather than get their own separate chain of command like Gallacher originally wanted. Not only that but Gallacher has strong-armed most of the unions into signing agreements with their bosses pledging that they will not strike for the duration of the War and a period of three years afterwards. All strikes currently ongoing have been ordered to stop by the unions. While the agreement has been met with joy across much of the country the far right has reacted with apoplectic rage. Meanwhile, almost daily opinion articles are appearing in papers across the nation decrying MacCormick for betraying Scotland and signing it away to the Syndicalist viper. On the other side of the radical spectrum the SILP's Leader James Maxton in a speech in Glasgow slammed the STUC for having 'finally showed everyone that they've sold out the People, what a bloody tragedy." However, for now these cries of anger come from a minority of a minority of people and can be safely ignored."
sctrevolt.21.a:0 "Together for Independence!"

sctrevolt.22.t:0 "The Treaty of Glasgow"
sctrevolt.22.d:0 "Today the President received a startling message from London, the English were asking for terms. While the war was going well for Scotland many had figured that the Scottish Army would have to storm London before Moseley would give in. They will never know if they were right or not. Instead, with Scottish and Welsh troops breaking British defenses at all points, General Thomas Edward Lawrence marched on London instead. Moseley is gone and the new government wants only to bring peace to the Isles…at least for now. The two sides gathered in Glasgow to come up with a treaty as celebrations filled the streets of Scotland. The negotiations were agonizing as all negotiations are. The English wanted to give Scotland as little as possible while Scottish negotiators tried to pry out a guarantee of independence among other concessions. In the end however the two sides finally came to an agreement and copies were sent to each nation's capitals. The signing in London was reportedly a rather solemn affair and a totally different story to the Scottish signing. In Edinburgh John MacCormick signed the document in a public park, surrounded by the countrymen and women he had started this to save. Afterwards the treaty, in its entirety, was read aloud to the crowd who then started a party that lasted so long they drank all the whiskey in the city."
