### Ideas ###
KUB_Powerful_Cooperation_Movement:0 "Powerful Cooperation Movement"
KUB_Powerful_Cooperation_Movement_desc:0 "Unlike other parts of the collapsed empire, Kuban is known for its massive, widespread and extremely powerful cooperative movement. For several decades, cooperation has developed in the region, and there are now several consumer cooperatives, the most prominent among them being Kubsoyuz and Yuskvet. \n\nCooperation helped Kuban become a breadbasket during the civil war, and during independence, helped it become an overly wealthy and prosperous region of the Black Sea. \n\nHowever, along with this, the cooperatives' influence on the internal and external politics of the Krai also rose, and in many ways they became the shadow government of the republic.\n\n§YThe modifiers are tied to the §NRadical Socialist§! and §mMarket Liberal§! popularities§!"
KUB_Divided_Region:0 "Divided Region"
KUB_Divided_Region_desc:0 "According to popular opinion, in the flag of Kuban the blue color symbolizes the Russian-speaking Cossacks, the crimson color symbolizes the Ukrainian-speaking Cossacks, and the green color symbolizes the Muslim minority.\n\nIn reality, things are no better. Kuban is divided between different peoples, nationalities and social groups by culture, income, origin and position. Further division can lead to significant instability."
KUB_KPA:0 "Kuban Insurgent Army"
KUB_KPA_desc:0 "Soon after the final annexation of Kuban first to the White Army and then to the new, restored Russia, active guerrilla uprisings began in the region, initiated by the Kuban Insurgent Army under the leadership of Vasil Ryabokon. It was they who eventually contributed to the seizure of power in Kuban in 1925. Despite the fact that power was peacefully transferred to the reconstituted Kuban Provincial Rada, the influence of the KPA was still significant."
KUB_Unification_Sentiments:0 "Integration Sentiments"
KUB_Unification_Sentiments_desc:0 "In the past there have been several attempts to reunite Kuban with Ukraine. However, the hesitance of the Hetman government eventually led to the seizure of Kuban by the White armies.\nDuring the last 10 years of the Black Sea government, it seems that reunification with Ukraine is nothing more than a political game and a flirting with Ukrainophile sentiments in society. Perhaps the Kuban and Ukrainian governments can agree on Kuban joining the Kingdom, but how will other forces within the people's republic perceive this?"

KUB_rada:0 "Kuban Regional Rada"

Since the establishment of the Second Kuban Republic in 1925, numerous efforts have been made to raise the ships from the Bay and most were successful. However, most of the ships were not subjects to restoration. The only warships returned to service were Kaliakria and Kerch.\n\nThe government never stopped and in January 1936 it is planned to raise a transport ship, known as a former British steamship 'Frederica'."

In the situation of imminent collapse of the Republic, perhaps it is better to announce the retirement to calm down the people and wait for the re-election."
KUB_Kuban_Ukrainian_Convention:0 "Kuban-Ukrainian 1936 Convention"
KUB_Kuban_Ukrainian_Convention_desc:0 "The 1936 Kuban-Ukrainian Convention, drafted by Luka Bych, current foreign minister, suggests even greater integration into Ukrainian sphere of influence. It will allow Ukrainian navy and army to enter the territory of our republic.\n\nThe Convention is radically rejected by the Lineitsy, up to open sabotage and protest.

KUB_Economic_Relief:0 "Economic Relief"

KUB_Peasant_Cossack_Divide_desc:0 "The Cossacks feel themselves as masters in the region, despite all those peasants who struggle to survive and have no land at all.

KUB_Fight_Syndicalist_Tendencies:0 "Fight Syndicalist Tendencies"
KUB_Fight_Syndicalist_Tendencies_desc:0 "Our efforts have been perceived as a latent anarcho-syndicalism.

### Events ###
kub.1.t:0 "History of the Kuban People's Republic"
kub.1.d:0 "Proclaimed in 1918, the Kuban People's Republic found itself at the center of political strife in the Don-Kuban region. Power changed hands several times, and the indecisiveness of Hetman Ukraine prevented the Kuban from defending itself against its enemies. As a result, it was annexed to the Armed Forces of Southern Russia. In response, an insurgent movement led by Ryabokon in the Kuban flared up.\n\nThis was until 1925, when instability in Russia led to the separation of the Don, Kuban and North Caucasus from Russia. Power passed into the hands of the Kuban Insurgent Army, which revived the People's Republic and the Regional Rada.\n\nVasil Ivanis, a prominent leader of the pro-Ukrainian Black Sea faction, was elected the new ataman of the republic.\nStable economic growth, a strong cooperative movement, and democratic traditions allowed Kuban to become one of the most successful splinters of the former Russian empire. \n\nHowever, incessant conflicts between the two parliamentary factions, pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian, wore down our politics, but at the same time ensured good relations with both Russia and the Reichspacht. However, who knows if this is just the calm before the storm."
kub.1.a:0 "You, Kuban, you're our Motherland!"

kub.2.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Kuban"
kub.2.d:0 "The Berlin Stock Crisis has reached Kuban as well. With our neighboring Don Republic also feeling their part of the devastation brought on by the disaster, the Germans have begun withdrawing their businesses, investments, and other forms of capital from our nation, further crippling our economy. We are in a free fall, and must act quickly in order to save our nation from total ruin."
kub.2.a:0 "It's a disaster!"

kub.3.t:0 "Nikolay Bukretov Found Dead!"
kub.3.d:0 "The recent news reports that one of the officers of the Kuban People's Republic, former Ataman in 1919, Nikolay Bukretov, has suddenly passed away at the age of 60, being found dead in his study early this morning."
kub.3.a:0 "Rest in peace!"

kub.4.t:0 "Elections of the New Ataman"
kub.4.d:0 "After the elections, the Regional Rada should vote on a new ataman. There are several main candidates from each major faction of the Rada: Vasil Ivanis, supported by pro-Ukrainian Chernomortsy, Vasil Ryabokon, the KPA leader, Aleksandr Filimonov, supported by pro-Russian Lineitsy and Vyacheslav Naumenko, another candidate from Lineitsy. It is likely that the Rada will choose the candidate from the ruling faction..." 
kub.4.a:0 "Let us wait for the result."

kub.5.t:0 "New Ataman Elected"
kub.5.d:0 "The last of the campaign stops have ended and the race is over, and the Rada is finally ready to announce who they have chosen to appoint as the new Ataman after weeks of deliberation and debate."
kub.5.a:0 "Ivanis is re-elected Ataman. Kuban and Ukraine will become a whole!"
kub.5.b:0 "Filimonov is chosen as Ataman!"
kub.5.c:0 "Vasil Ryabokon is chosen instead of Ivanis!"
kub.5.e:0 "Lineitsy managed to negotiate Naumenko candidacy"

kub.6.t:0 "1936 Kuban Elections"
kub.6.d:0 "This year in the elections there are several political forces participating: the Chernomortsy, who are allied with Ukraine, and Lineitsy, who are allied with Russia. The result will depend on the popularity of the parties amongst the citizens and their comparative power in the Regional Rada."
kub.6.a:0 "Let us wait for the result."

kub.60.t:0 "Chernomortsy Victorious!"
kub.60.d:0 "Due to their popular campaign and effective propaganda, the Ukrainian speaking, Reichspakt-aligned Chernomortsy party of the Black Sea Host has gained the majority of votes."
kub.60.a:0 "Congratulations."

kub.61.t:0 "Lineitsy Victorious!"
kub.61.d:0 "Due to their popular campaigns and effective propaganda, the Lineitsy faction has gained the majority of votes. Their pro-Russian agenda will now come to dominate our politics."


kub.7.t:0 "Start the Spring Session"
kub.7.d:0 "The New Year Holidays are over and it is time to start the annual Kuban Regional Rada session.\nAs usual, the main debates are between the plans of the Lineitsy delegates and the Chernomortsy factions. This time, we shall discuss the direction of the economy and the possibility of new army reform, while also attempting to iron out several smaller internal issues our regime is currently dealing with."
kub.7.a:0 "Exciting!"

kub.8.t:0 "Nikolay Ryabovol Opening Speech"
kub.8.d:0 "Nikolay Ryabovol, one of the leaders of the Chernomortsy faction, has spoken today in the Regional Rada, demanding further cooperation with Mitteleuropa. He emphasizes cooperation with Germany in particular as a means to protect against Russian aggression but also seeks to work closely with the Ukranians.\nAs the question of Kuban's foreign policy still remains unsolved, the topic of becoming a member of the German sphere of influence is a fast growing to be another hot debate between the deputies."
kub.8.a:0 "Chernomortsy trying to draw us away from Russia."

kub.9.t:0 "Filimonov's Address to the Nation"
kub.9.d:0 "Aleksandr Filimonov has presented the Lineitsy's 1936 National Budget, which includes amendments that call for fierce cooperation with Russian government. While many claim that Filimonov's speech is a criticizing response to Ryabovol's Ukrainophile plan, the idea of returning back to Russia is a popular idea amongst many Kuban citizens."
kub.9.a:0 "Chernomortsy and Lineitsy argue as usual."

kub.10.t:0 "The Upcoming Elections"
kub.10.d:0 "This year also brings with it the new legislative regional elections, with an active political campaign of both Chernomortsy and Lineitsy. Currently, Chernomortsy hold the majority in the parliament, having 32 seats out of 60 in the Regional Rada and Luka Bych being the current prime minister and chairman of Rada.\nThis will be a challenge for Lineitsy to get the majority, however, they also have plenty of supporters in Kuban to tap into for support."
kub.10.a:0 "Who will win?"

kub.11.t:0 "Direction of the Economy"
kub.11.d:0 "With Ataman Bukretov trying to keep Kuban's neutrality, both factions in the Rada have their own economic plans for Kuban. While the Chernomortsy look forward to cooperating with prosperous economies of Germany and Ukraine, the Lineitsy see our future with Russia and its developing economy. While some predict the very end of the German economy, some hope that the new Russian government will become a vital world economy in the next few years. Do we go with the struggling giant or the possible up and coming power?"
kub.11.a:0 "The Chernomortsy are right - we must cooperate with Germany."
kub.11.b:0 "The Lineitsy are right - Russia has potential."

kub.12.t:0 "Cossack Army"
kub.12.d:0 "The Kuban Cossack Host, consisting of Black Sea and Caucasus Line cossacks hosts needs to be reformed as soon as possible. In the new century, the cavalry tactics of old cannot protect our nation from the tanks and mechanized forces of foreign powers.\nTwo plans are available for us to choose from: turning our forces towards motorized, fast attack tactics, or improving the artillery and support equipment of our army, using superior weaponry to rain down fire upon our foes."
kub.12.a:0 "Motorized Cossack Force!"
kub.12.b:0 "Improve the Artillery."

kub.13.t:0 "Kuban Asks for a Bailout"
kub.13.d:0 "The government of the Kuban People's Republic has asked us for a bailout. While we are currently trying to deal with our problems first, Kuban can be a vital ally in our confrontation with Russia and open the Caucasus to us - and its black gold."
kub.13.a:0 "Help them a bit."
kub.13.b:0 "Promise something, do nothing."
kub.13.c:0 "Who is Kuban?"

kub.14.t:0 "Germany Agreed to Help"
kub.14.d:0 "The German Empire agreed to help us, despite all the instability. This is a great victory for Chernomortsy, indeed, as it opens ways for further cooperation with Mitteleuropa."
kub.14.a:0 "Splendid!"

kub.15.t:0 "Germany Promise to Help"
kub.15.d:0 "Germany promised to help our economy to recover. However, their help is not totally guaranteed. But we can rely on this information and try to get closer to Germany in the future."
kub.15.a:0 "Something, at least."

kub.16.t:0 "Germany Refused to Help"
kub.16.d:0 "German government refused to help us! This is a great disappointment for Chernomortsy and their voters."
kub.16.a:0 "Perhaps we shall work with Russia then?"

kub.17.d:0 "The government of the Kuban People's Republic has asked us for a bailout. While we are currently trying to deal with our own problems first, it can be a first step to peacefully return Kuban into the Motherland."
kub.17.c:0 "We don't negotiate with traitors."

kub.18.t:0 "Russia Agreed to Help"
kub.18.d:0 "Russia agreed to help us, despite all the instability. This is a great victory for Lineitsy, indeed, as it opens ways for further cooperation with Russia."

kub.19.t:0 "Russia Promised to Help"
kub.19.d:0 "Russia promised to help our economy to recover. However, their help is not totally guaranteed. But we can rely on this information and try to get closer to Russia in the future."

kub.20.t:0 "Russia Refused to Help"
kub.20.d:0 "Russian government refused to help us! This is a great disappointment for the Lineitsy and their voters."
kub.20.a:0 "Perhaps we shall work with Germany then?"

kub.21.t:0 "Economy Recovers"
kub.21.d:0 "Thanks to all the measures, our economy has begun to slowly recover from the Berlin Stock Crisis. Though far from over, our recovery is now well on its way. Soon, our economy will be back to its pre-collapse form."
kub.21.a:0 "Amazing!"

kub.22.t:0 "Language Issue"
kub.22.d:0 "Same as parliamentary factions, our nation is split between Ukrainian-speaking and Russian-speaking regions. However, Ukrainian is still not an official language in our country, despite all the efforts made by Chernomortsy. This issue shall be solved this year, and Chernomortsy are already promising to finally solve it."
kub.22.a:0 "A great pre-election promise."

kub.23.t:0 "Circassian Minority"
kub.23.d:0 "The nation, known as Circassians or Adyghe is a muslim minority, that lives in the West Circassia and North Caucasus districts in Kuban. While their district have representation in the Regional Rada with North Caucasus having 4 seats and West Circassia only 1 seat, they are held by Chernomortsy or Lineitsy deputies. The Circassians de-facto have no representation in the parliament and currently they don't have equal rights with other Kuban citizens. This issue has been a headache since the foundation of the Kuban People's Republic, leading to strained relations with the Mountain Republic who recognize Circassia as a part of their state. We shall guarantee equal rights for Circassians in the following convocation of Regional Rada."
kub.23.a:0 "Another issue to deal with."  

kub.24.t:0 "Ukrainian As a Second Language?"
kub.24.d:0 "The issue of the Ukrainian language should finally be solved. Now there are three options for us: recognize Ukrainian language as a second official language in the Kuban, forbid Ukrainian language or keep the status quo. The choice depends on our government’s predispositions, however."
kub.24.a:0 "Make Ukrainian the official language alongside Russian."
kub.24.b:0 "Keep the status quo."
kub.24.c:0 "Forbid the public use of Ukrainian."

kub.25.t:0 "The Peasantry-Cossack Conflict"
kub.25.d:0 "Since the foundation of the Kuban People's Republic, the conflict between cossacks and peasantry has been a major problem. The cossacks, who make up less than half of our nation’s population, own 80% of land and production while local peasantry live in poverty and squalor. When Kuban once again declared its independence in 1925, the situation became much better, with peasants gaining voting rights and their farmland being nationalized under the state and out of greedy corporate hands. However, the policy of Ataman Bukretov led to further oppression of peasants. The Regional Rada should do something about this, either helping peasants and farmers, or finally centralising our state under Cossack rule."
kub.25.a:0 "Favour the peasants."
kub.25.b:0 "Favour the cossacks."

kub.26.t:0 "The Circassian Minority"
kub.26.d:0 "Something should be done with the Circassian issue. We can either grant them autonomy and receive popularity and stability in the region, or let them leave for the Mountain Republic and make Circassia a true cossack land."
kub.26.a:0 "An autonomy for Circassians."
kub.26.b:0 "Exile them to Mountaineers."

kub.27.t:0 "Sochi"
kub.27.d:0 "The region of Sochi, especially the city of Sochi itself, is populated by Russians and Ukrainians in a large majority over the ruling Georgians. However, Georgia stole these lands from us when our great state was oppressed under Russia boot of the Tsarist regime of old. Now, we get numerous reports from the local population that Georgians are oppressing them! We can either demand the return of this land, or keep the status-quo intact, hoping the situation will get any better soon..."
kub.27.a:0 "Demand Sochi back."
kub.27.c:0 "Save the status-quo."

kub.28.t:0 "Georgia Accepts."
kub.28.d:0 "Georgia has agreed to return Sochi to us without a drop of blood being spilt. This is a great victory for our foreign ministry and for the Kuban people as a whole. Let us celebrate at once!"
kub.28.a:0 "Splendid."

kub.29.t:0 "Georgia Refused."
kub.29.d:0 "Georgia has refused our request to return the region of Sochi to our hands. This is a travesty, and a slap in the face to our international prestige. Shall we slink back into our holes or stand strong and meet the Georgian menace on the field of battle?."
kub.29.a:0 "Sochi is Kuban!"
kub.29.b:0 "We cannot seize it right now..." 

kub.290.t:0 "Peace with Kuban?"
kub.290.d:0 "The Kuban forces have occupied our territory of Sochi. We can either sign a peace treaty and end the war, avoiding the spilling of innocent [ROOT.GetAdjective] lives, or we can stand vigilant and defend our borders and their integrity from these cossack aggressors."
kub.290.a:0 "Offer them peace."
kub.290.b:0 "We will never surrender."

kub.291.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Offers Peace"
kub.291.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetName] offered us peace and Sochi. Our military might has scared them into offering up the territory we claim before any serious amount of lives are thrown away in needless conflict. What shall be our response?"
kub.291.a:0 "Accept the treaty, Sochi was always the goal."
kub.291.b:0 "We shall destroy [FROM.GetName]."

kub.292.t:0 "Peace over Sochi?"
kub.292.d:0 "We were unable to occupy Sochi. We must send a peace delegation to stop this aimless war. Hopefully we can prevent further needless bloodshed."
kub.292.a:0 "Send the delegation at once!"

kub.293.t:0 "Sochi Is Ours!"
kub.293.d:0 "In combat at the borders of the city of Sochi we managed to finally crush the Georgian Army and protect Sochi. The Georgians must accept their defeat!"
kub.293.a:0 "Sochi is our rightful territory!"

kub.294.t:0 "Sochi Is Ours!"
kub.294.d:0 "Despite the Cossacks have seized our land, we managed to bring it back under our control, kicking the Kubans out of Sochi region they have been occupying."
kub.294.a:0 "Sochi is our rightful territory!"

kub.295.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands Sochi!"
kub.295.d:0 "The region of Sochi, occupied by our forces during the Russian Civil War, has been as well ratified in the Treaty of Minsk as our rightful territory. However, now the Kuban government demands that we return the city of Sochi!"
kub.295.a:0 "We can't afford such conflicts now."
kub.295.b:0 "Sochi is Georgia!"

kub.30.t:0 "Reforming the Regional Rada"
kub.30.d:0 "While the traditional system of Kuban Regional Rada has been keeping our nation together with Chernomortsy and Lineitsy counterbalancing each other, we should adapt a more democratic and more pro-Russian system of State Duma: a regular parliament with open elections. The Regional Rada will be disbanded and the State Duma should appear instead."
kub.30.a:0 "Let's do this."


kub.100.t:0 "The Savior Is Here"
kub.100.d:0 "Today, the armed cossack forces of general Viktor Pokrovskiy have rushed into the Ataman's residence in Yekaterinodar and arrested him. Soon after, Pokrovskiy proclaimed himself the new Ataman of the Republic and dissolved the Rada. Due to the incompetence of the former government, especially in its failure of its duties to protect people, as Pokrovskiy argued, his duty is to save his Motherland and its people from chaos and anarchy."
kub.100.a:0 "The Savior will protect us."

kub.101.t:0 "Dissolve the Kuban Regional Rada"
kub.101.d:0 "The Rada has for long been a hurdle to the true goals and needs of the Kuban people, with its deputies sitting there for over a decade, doing nothing but arguing and growing more fat and decadent. The Rada should be immediately dissolved. Those who are not with us, are against us. Only the firm hand of our new Ataman will help us to overcome the crisis."
kub.101.a:0 "Close this talking shop."

kub.102.t:0 "Ban Ukrainian Parties"
kub.102.d:0 "Several Ukrainian parties, including USDRP and UPSF which closely cooperated with Chernomortsy faction, should have nothing to do within our nation’s politics. They had no chance to sustain their democracy in Ukraine and it is stupid to think they can here succeed in a foreign country. We must ban these groups at once to stop the foul taint of the Ukranians from sullying our state."
kub.102.a:0 "Kuban for Kubans"

kub.103.t:0 "Ban Ukrainian Language"
kub.103.d:0 "For too long, the influence of our large Ukranian minority has been spreading throughout the Kuban republic. Since the first Chernomortsy party programme, where they stated that the Kuban region should be a part of Ukraine, this plague has wrought its toll on our people. We should ban speaking Ukrainian in public places and in official meetings, and ban teaching Ukrainian at schools and universities."
kub.103.a:0 "Worth enough to save the nation."

kub.104.t:0 "Traitors Everywhere!"
kub.104.d:0 "Kuban is being dissolved into parts, being ripped apart piecemeal by various vulturous groups. Whoever they are - Ukrainians, Circassians, Chechens, Kalmyks - they all want their piece of a pie, lying in wait, ready to strike when we are most vulnerable. In response to this, as the Savior has decreed, we will consolidate our grip over all of Kuban and destroy every last enemy of the state that threatens our unity."
kub.104.a:0 "Everything for the state!"

kub.105.t:0 "The Savior Is Here"
kub.105.d:0 "Today, the armed cossack forces of general Viktor Pokrovskiy have rushed into the Kuban Rada and arrested Vasil Ivanis. Soon after, Pokrovskiy proclaimed himself the new Ataman of the Republic and dissolved the Rada. Due to the incompetence of the former government, especially in its failure of its duties to protect people, as Pokrovskiy argued, his duty is to save his Motherland and its people from chaos and anarchy."
kub.105.a:0 "The Savior will protect us."


kub.200.t:0 "The Don-Kuban Union?"
kub.200.d:0 "The peoples of Don and Kuban are ethnically, culturally and politically one people in all senses of the word, with only insignificant borders dividing us. We should end this era of separation and humiliation, and finally proclaim the United Don-Kuban republic, a republic for all cossacks between the Black and Caspian seas!"
kub.200.a:0 "Send the offer to the Don Republic"
kub.200.b:0 "Declare war on those who occupy these lands!"

kub.201.t:0 "The Don-Kuban Union?"
kub.201.d:0 "The government of the Don-Kuban Union has offered to join them in a union. While our nations can be similar in a variety of facts, our political interests can differ greatly."
kub.201.a:0 "Accept their offer - the Cossacks shall be united."
kub.201.b:0 "Nonsense! We will never agree to such a silly proposal."

kub.202.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Agreed!"
kub.202.d:0 "The Don government agreed to sign the Union treaty. We shall march hand in hand under the banner of a united Don-Kuban Union! Finally, peace and unity has reached the land between two seas."
kub.202.a:0 "Lyubo, bratsy, lyubo!"

kub.203.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused!"
kub.203.d:0 "The Don government refused to sign the Union treaty. Those traitorous dogs do not know what they are missing, and now our union shall be left to die unless we draw blood. We can either crush these fools and reinstate the great Don-Kuban Union by force, or let the idea fade into the dustbin of history."
kub.203.a:0 "We shall crush these traitors!"
kub.203.b:0 "War will only tear us apart, abandon the idea."

kub.1000.t:0 "Raising 'Frederica' From Tsemes Bay"
kub.1000.d:0 "In 1926, with Ukrainian help, we began to raise the ships of the Black Sea Fleet, sunk in the Tsemes Bay in 1918 by the Bolsheviks. By the demand of the Brest Peace Treaty, the fleet was to be handed over to Germany, but the sailors preferred to sink the ships.\n\nSince then several ships have been raised, many of which have been dismantled for scrap metal. Only a few ships were successfully raised and restored: the destroyers Kaliakria and Kerch, the tanker Elbrus, and the transport ship Generosa. \n\nDespite the setbacks, the government is still trying to raise the remaining ships from the bottom, although each time the hope that at least some of them can be recovered diminishes. The lifting of the Frederica, also a transport ship, has finally taken place."
kub.1000.a:0 "Unfortunately, it can't be repaired..."

kub.1001.t:0 "Rada Debate Ends in Deadlock"
kub.1001.d:0 "With the Black Monday crushing our economy, the solution to the crisis was raised in the Rada. However, the opposition could not agree with Chernomortsy on the main solutions. We must quickly do something to revive our economy, otherwise we will find ourselves in the state of civil war."
kub.1001.a:0 "Ataman should intervene."

kub.1002.d:0 "The Convention between [KUB.GetNameDefCap] and the Kingdom of Ukraine, agreed earlier in 1935 and with difficulty ratified in the Regional Rada, with increased opposition from the Lineitsy, established mutual agreements between the countries on Ukraine's access to the port of Novorossiysk, as well as the possibility of placing a contingent of the Hetman Army on the territory of Kuban."

He sees it as an only way out of the policial crisis.\n\nHe also announced his intention to dissolve the Regional Rada and schedule new elections for September. The new government and parliament will have to solve all the pressing problems and appoint a new Ataman. In addition, Ivanis noted that he plans to become one of the candidates for ataman, and that his resignation is temporary and only a pretext to stabilize the situation.\n\nAt the same time, Prime Minister Bych condemned Ataman's decision and urged not to dissolve the Rada at such a crucial time, and called on Rada members to agree on measures to combat the economic crisis."
kub.1004.a:0 "Who leaves his office in such dire times?"

kub.1005.t:0 "Dissolving Regional Rada"
kub.1005.d:0 "Ataman Vasil Ivanis now faced a choice: dissolve the rampaging parliament, unable to make a single adequate decision, or leave it running until the situation stabilizes? It seems that the fate of the entire Republic depended on this decision."

kub.1007.d:0 "Today the Host of Pokrovsky’s loyalists have tried to seize the city of Novorossiysk, but there they were met by the KPA resistance.

kub.1011.d:0 "We decided to get ready for the battle, but that was our mistake. Soon the Cooperatives have rallied a decent amount of supporters into the remnants of the KPA. When we tried to take over the city, they let us in, but only to surround us and fight till Pokrovsky was captured and arrested. However, he never did it to the court... there was a lynching of the so-called Savior, but better known to all as the Butcher of Maikop, took place.\n\nThe next day, the Kubsoyuz has proclaimed the creation of the Republic of the United Cooperatives of Kuban. And there are not many forces that still resist their rule."
kub.1011.a:0 "Demand Lineitsy to lay down their arms."

kub.1012.t:0 "The Soviet Uprising"
kub.1012.d:0 "Having rallied a small amount of workers, but a rather decent amount of peasants, a person, known as Yan Poluyan, has announced the restoration of the Kuban Soviet. He demanded that the power in the republic should be in the hands of its people, not a Cossack.\n\nWhile his forces have gained some strength, they are still outnumbered by our host. The only decision to be made is either we should fight the crowd of protesters or not..."
kub.1012.a:0 "Destroy all who protest! That's the only way to liberate Kuban."
kub.1012.b:0 "We should not shed any more blood."

kub.1013.t:0 "The Proclamation of the Soviet Republic"
kub.1013.d:0 "On the orders of the Maikop Butcher, the crazy Cossacks began to slaughter the crowd of protesters. Soon after, more people came out to defend the people, who began to fight the Cossacks, thanks to the devastated arms depots. Soon their forces were outnumbered, many of Pokrovsky's detachment were destroyed, and he himself was disarmed and given to be lynched by the crowd.\n\nThe next day Yan Poluyan has proclaimed the Kuban-Black Sea Soviet Republic."
kub.1013.a:0 "The people of the Kuban were finally liberated!"

kub.1014.t:0 "Intervene in Kuban?"
kub.1014.d:0 "The dramatic events are taking place in the Kuban region, where various groups are slaughtering each other for the power. The only loyal force to us in the region, the Lineitsy of the Caucasus Line Cossack Host have asked our government to intervene in the conflict. We can invade the Stavropol region, where they are located in order to save them from a tragic fate."
kub.1014.a:0 "We don't have time for it right now..."
kub.1014.b:0 "Intervene in Stavropol!"

kub.1015.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Intervenes!"
kub.1015.d:0 "It seems like the Lineitsy have asked the [FROM.GetAdjective] government to intervene and save them. Today the troops of the Don Host have crossed the borders and annexed the Stavropol region, preventing us from dealing with Lineitsy."
kub.1015.a:0 "We will return this land later."

kub.1016.t:0 "Lineitsy Escape en-Masse!"
kub.1016.d:0 "After the tragic news from Yekaterinodar and Novorossiysk, the Caucasus Line Cossack Host leaders and officers have started to cross the border with Don en-Masse! It seems that we will capture Stavropol without much resistance."
kub.1016.a:0 "Good riddance"

kub.1017.t:0 "Cossacks from Caucasus Line Host Arrive"
kub.1017.d:0 "Following the tragic events in Yekaterinodar and Novorossiysk, the Caucasus Line Cossack Host has decided to flee the Kuban region to save their lives. They have arrived in our country today and asked to join our forces."
kub.1017.a:0 "Alright."
kub.1017.b:0 "Let them stay here, but they should not fight along our army."

kub.1018.t:0 "Leaders of the Caucasus Line Host Arrested!"
kub.1018.d:0 "After the tragic events in Yekaterinodar and Novorossiysk, the leaders of the Caucasus Line Host have offered no restistance to our forces. Soon, their notable leaders were arrested."
kub.1018.a:0 "It's good thing they gave up."

kub.1019.t:0 "Poluyan Arrested"
kub.1019.d:0 "We decided to let the protesters express their emotions, but instead of fighting them we have ordered Shkuro, our loyal officer, to find out the location of their leader. He did his job well and soon Poluyan was arrested. The people were shown that their leader was arrested and Pokrovsky demanded they all to go home. Without any political leadership, the protesters soon understood that they cannot fight to the armed Cossacks. Poluyan, however, was hanged."
kub.1019.a:0 "Time to implement the policies of cleansed Kuban!" 

kub.1020.t:0 "Denouncing Kuban-Ukrainian Convention"
kub.1020.d:0 "The Convention signed by the previous government with Ukraine is no longer a reality. [ROOT.GetLeader] has publicly criticized and denounced the Convention, unilaterally withdrawing from the treaty."
kub.1020.a:0 "Down with Ukrainian influence!"

kub.1021.t:0 "Kuban Denounced 1936 Convention!"
kub.1021.d:0 "The new Kuban government has unilaterally withdrawn from the Convention, signed earlier by the previous government."
kub.1021.a:0 "Have we lost Kuban?"

kub.1022.t:0 "Kuban Suggests Customs Union"
kub.1022.d:0 "The Kuban government has approached us with an agreement to sign the Customs Union. It will allow our countries to trade freely between each other. Moreover, the Union will introduce a shared external tariff. Finally, the economic efficiency will be increased as well as closer political and cultural ties between our countries will be established."
kub.1022.a:0 "Interesting."

kub.1023.t:0 "Ukraine Ratifies Customs Union!"
kub.1023.d:0 "The Ukrainian government has finally ratified our Customs Union agreement. It means that since the beginning of the next month we will share a free trade zone with Ukraine!"
kub.1023.a:0 "Great!"

kub.1024.t:0 "'Free Borders' Zone with Kuban?"
kub.1024.d:0 "Despite we don't have a direct border with Kuban, except for the Kerch isthmus, people from Kuban are often travelling to Ukraine, which is also correct to say about Ukrainians, travelling to Kuban. With the new 'Free Border' agreement the citizens of our countries won't need any additional bureaucracy to go through in order to travel between Kuban and Ukraine."
kub.1024.a:0 "Splendid!"

kub.1025.t:0 "Ukraine Signs 'Free Borders' Zone"
kub.1025.d:0 "Finally, Ukraine has ratified the free borders agreement, allowing citizens from our countries to travel freely without any restrictions."
kub.1025.a:0 "One step forward unification!"

kub.1026.t:0 "Kuban-Ukrainian Federative Treaty?"
kub.1026.d:0 "The Kuban government has decided to propose the final step of the Kuban integration into Ukrainian sphere of influence. They have proposed for two our countries to sign the Federative Treaty, which will introduce the Kuban in its current borders into [UKR.GetName] as an autonomous region."
kub.1026.a:0 "The Day of Reunification is closer and closer!"

kub.1027.t:0 "Ukraine Welcomes Kuban Autonomous Region!"
kub.1027.d:0 "The Ukrainian government has done everything it should in order to officially recognize us as a part of their country. We have received a good amount of autonomy: at least, the Kuban Regional Rada has stayed, though it is likely that with introduction of Ukrainian parties to the region, the influence of pro-Russian forces will be smaller and smaller.\nMoreover, [KUB.GetLeader] will stay as the leader of our region, but in a role of Governor."
kub.1027.a:0 "Hooray!"

kub.1028.t:0 "Ukraine Restores Zaporozhian Host!"
kub.1028.d:0 "Several centuries have passed since the Zaporozhian Host was forcefully disbanded by the Russian Empire. Now, with the establishement of the Free Cossack Society - Vilne Kozatstvo, the Ukrainian government has suggested to restore the host in its original lands in the Zaporozhian region of Ukraine.\nAs our people are direct ancestors of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, much of the Kuban Cossacks are ready to move to their homeland to build up the new Host."
kub.1028.a:0 "Historical justice has been served!"

kub.1029.t:0 "Ukraine Invests in Our Navy"
kub.1029.d:0 "The leadership of the Ukrainian Navy, in addition to joint exercises, also insisted that the government provide investment for the development of the Kuban Black Sea Fleet in Novorossiysk. We received two destroyers from Sevastopol and also the best Ukrainian naval specialists came to Novorossiysk to train our naval forces in new tactics."
kub.1029.a:0 "Splendid!"

kub.1030.t:0 "Renaming Yekaterinodar"
kub.1030.d:0 "The suggestion, proposed by our Chairman, Yan Poluyan, today in the Council is as good as always: he offered the city council of Yekaterinodar to rename the city into a more appropriate name - Krasnodar."
kub.1030.a:0 "Nice idea!"
