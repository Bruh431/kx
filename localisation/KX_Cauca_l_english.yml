cau.300.t:0 "Our Second Language"
cau.300.d:0 "Controlling language is one of the keys to unlocking complete power. Recognising this, we have issued an important decree in regards to the official language of our new state, which has become a delicate topic to say the least.\n\nAll other tribes and their native tongue were considered, except for the Tayronas who are still adamant in continuing their isolation. The most promising are the Wayuu, who speak Wayuunaiki and are located in the North-East region of La Guajira, since they are by far the largest group on the list. Furthermore, they are renowned for being one of the very last tribes to be conquered, only being defeted just after Venezuela had seperated from Gran Colombia. Secondly are the Senú, also called Zenú, located halfway between Medellin and Cartagena, whose native tongue was lost to them many years ago by fault of the Conquistadors - the main reason, as we suspect, to their advocacy of keeping Spanish as a second language. Lastly, there are the Muisca who originate near Bogota and speak Chibcha. Despite being a rather small group, someone had pointed out that they were nonetheless the most important and most well-known natives in the eyes of foreign nations worldwide - to choose them would probably legitimise our state greatly internationally and internally. The question is clear; which tongue should we pick as our official second language?"
cau.300.a:0 "We stand stronger together - Wayuunaiki."
cau.300.b:0 "It wouldn't be difficult to stick with Spanish."
cau.300.c:0 "Chibcha. The Muiscas will legitimise our cause."
cau.989.t:0 "The Renaiming Proposal"
cau.989.d:0 "Now that the war is over and that we came out victorious in our struggle against the white man that oppressed us for hundreds and hundreds of years, the council is requesting to take action in establishing our sovregnity over our ancestral lands. With such a diverse council, formed by different tribes of different cultures the opinion on what to do came up very varied. On one thing however pretty much everyone aggrees: the various deparments of what once was known as Colombia, along with the name of most cities, bear a name that represent the white man, and not the people that lives here since the beginning of time. It's the case of the Santander department, named as such after a white general that liberated the white men from other white men -but keeped the 'indios' subjugated, or the Narino department that shares a name with the man who brought from France and translated to spanish the Declaration of Human Right, but that never thought of translating the same document to any indigenous language. And one can't even count the amount of cities that are called 'Saint...Whatever'. The council deliberated that our sons and the future generation should not live in cities named after european mitological figures or catholic saints, but they should, instead, learn to call Bogotá and Medellin as Bacatá and Aburrá, according to their historical pre-hispanic names.\nShould we proceed with this operation?"
cau.989.a:0 "That's the logical fist step. Proceed."
cau.989.b:0 "That would be too much."
