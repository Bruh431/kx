POLITICS_GEORGE_DESC:0 "Born 3 June 1865, the second son to the future Edward VII, there was little expectation that George Windsor would become King and as such he was destined for a career in the navy. But following the death of his older brother to influenza in 1892, he was made Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the throne, ending his naval career. Having grown close during the shared period of mourning for his brother, George would marry Princess Mary of Teck, his brother's fiancé and so would begin a loving, if little publicly expressed relationship. But his world would once again be thrown into turmoil when in 1911 his father would die, and George was forced to ascend to the throne as King George V. George had taken power at a politically turbulent time with the rising temper of the Irish Home Rule movement and the Liberals' growing conflict with the lords. While the constitutional crisis would ultimately see the reform of the Lords and a civil war temporarily averted in Ireland, the world would be cast into the fires of war as the Great War broke out with a despondent George at the helm. Despite his attempts to appease British nationalism by abandoning his German titles and adopting the name Windsor, Britain's loss in the Weltkrieg caused the already growing republican movement to experience a steady uptick in support. After years of poor governance and politicking, the British Revolution would break out and amid his dithering refusal to intervene in the political crisis, the King would be forced to flee Britain into exile and watch his home, along with his Empire, tumble into the abbyss.\n\nThe King-Emperor, as he styles himself still, has reigned over the British Empire, what's left of it, since his flight into exile. The loss of the Weltkrieg to his own cousin, the loss of his youngest son, John, and the final devastating loss of Britain itself have combined to break much of George V’s spirit despite his unending resolve to maintain his stature. With his health having worsened since the flight to Canada, which George privately refers to as “a frozen prison", he has gradually lost any interest in participating in domestic affairs, delegating such ceremonial duties as he may to his son, Prince Edward. He now lives on to spend what little time remains with his family and perhaps one day, the return to Britain, but this prospect grows dimmer by the day..."
POLITICS_EDWARD_DESC:0 "The first son of King George V, Edward VIII was born 23 June 1894 in the outskirts of London, named such after this late uncle. With a traditional childhood and tutoring, the young Prince was initially destined for a military schooling in the navy, first at Osborne and then Dartmouth. While a course of two years and entry into the navy was planned, this was cut short following his father's ascension to the throne. Preparations to prepare Edward for future leadership were started in earnest, being sent to Magdalen College at Oxford, despite allegations of being underprepared intellectually, ultimately leaving Oxford after eight terms, without any academic qualifications. By the time of the Great War, Edward was of legal age to join and enthusiastically signed into the Grenadier Guards but was refused deployment to the frontlines in case the heir apparent be captured or killed. Nevertheless, he would travel to the frontlines as often as he could and undertook military flights from 1918 onwards, making him deeply popular among veterans for his eagerness to fight alongside them. But Edward would return to a country that was disillusioned by its defeat and suffering from economic depression, a fact Edward note on during his many tours of poverty-stricken areas of Britain to meet with local people and take on board their concerns. But despite his efforts to reach out to the common populace, Edward would be evacuated with his family to Canada in 1925 amid the British Revolution despite his proposal that he return to the frontlines to fight the syndicalist menace.\n\nIn exile, the young Edward would gradually take on many of the duties his father once performed, becoming a regent in all but name. But following his father's death, Edward of Windsor was crownded in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa, with all the pomp and circumstance afforded to his forebearers. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward has already proven himself prone to meddling in politics with his own radical views and a man of lustful scandal on par with Oswald Mosley. But he maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom will one day proudly fly above the Home Isles and the Empire shall be restored to its glory..."
POLITICS_ALBERT_WINDSOR_DESC:0 "Prince Albert of Windsor, younger Brother of British king Edward VIII, has been appointed Governor-General of Canada. Though ridiculed as a child for his noticeable stammer, Albert grew into a collected and dutiful man. While Canadians appreciate Albert's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that appointment to the post of Governor-General would be restored to the discretion of the Canadian parliament. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Albert is well liked. With Edward occupied with the reconstruction of the recently reconquered Britain, Albert toils diligently to ensure that Canada is properly governed."
POLITICS_ALBERT_DESC:0 "Born in December of 1895, the young Prince Albert was not expected to be a king. Growing up in Britain, he was always in the shadow of his brother, Prince Edward. Albert I was always known as a timid and reserved man, until near the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, when he attended an academy in 1909 and became a sailor in 1913. Despite constant seasickness, he served in the Battle of Jutland aboard the HMS Collingwood, and later served as a squadron leader until being injured in November of 1918, remaining in Britain for the rest of the war.\n\nAfter the war, Albert continued to live in Britain until the revolution, fleeing to Canada. The Prince was relatively irrelevant up until the rise of his brother as King, being next in line for the throne. Upon his brother’s abdication, the new King Albert I is seen as an equal if not better than his predecessor, as he is more willing to work with the Canadian government and British Exiles. Although the king suffers from constant sickness, he is seen as a beacon of hope by the British Exiles. For better or for worse, Albert I will lead the charge into the Home Isles."

CAN_canadian_battleships:0 "Canadian Battleships"
CAN_canadian_battleships_desc:0 "We must make a concerted effort to stay on the forefront of battleship design.

CAN_within_arms_reach:0 "Within Arm's Reach"
CAN_within_arms_reach_desc:0 "Our biggest obstacle to retaking the Home Isles, aside from the opposition of the syndicalists themselves, is the vast distance across the Atlantic we need to cross.

CAN_bring_on_valentine:0 "Bring on the Valentines"
CAN_bring_on_valentine_desc:0 "The tank is a fast, relatively lightly armed and armoured vehicle designed to exploit breakthroughs in the enemy line and achieve rapid advances and encirclement.

CAN_self_propelled_guns_desc:0 "A mobile army requires mobile fire support.

CAN_munitions_industry:0 "Canada's Munitions Industry"

CAN_home_coming_desc:0 "While it was hoped that our loyal subjects of the Crown would one day rise to tear down the Syndicalist beast, fate has proven such conclusions to be forlorn. With reality bearing its ugly teeth, we must realize the truth: we have practically sat idly by for nearly 20 years doing nothing but waiting for our moment to push off from Canada’s frigid shores. However, our moment is coming soon; the red menace is actively harming our home and the Exiles are eager to reclaim their birthright. It's high time we started preparations for the greatest military and civilian return in the history of humanity, be it by force, treaties or secret operations."
CAN_german_treaty:0 "Old Foe, Common Goal"
CAN_german_treaty_desc:0 "While we have our differences with the German Empire, we can not worry about old wounds right now. The focus is on reclaiming Great Britain. Thus our political leaders have suggested a treaty of non-aggression with the Germans, at least for the time being."

CAN_develop_iceland:0 "Improving the Condition of Iceland"
CAN_develop_iceland_desc:0 "The land of old Viking sagas is also a land struggling for survival. The earth there is not bountiful, and no modern nation can only live through the fishing industry.

CAN_sabatoge_uob_navy_desc:0 "During the Revolution, the majority of the Royal Navy stayed loyal to their sovereign, yet there were outliers. Although only few, they have sullied the honourable legacy of British waves by not only betraying their king, but also providing the foundation for the Unionist navy. Thankfully for us that rag-tag band of radical upstarts will be simple to sabotage and slowly dismantle, just like any armada that threatened us over our long history."
CAN_seize_shetland:0 "Seize Shetland and Orkney"
CAN_seize_shetland_desc:0 "The Northern Isles are not only vital to reestablishing control over Scotland, they are a home to the Scapa Flow naval complex.

CAN_mann_rebellion:0 "Man the Isle of Mann Mutiny"
CAN_mann_rebellion_desc:0 "Known as Ellan Vannin to the very distinct autochthons of the island, Mann is vital if we are to comfortably control the Irish Sea and project our power over both the lost home and lost dominion. We have to send our loyal men to connect with clandestine royalist cells both in the autonomous Tynwald legislature and the Man garrison to stage a grand mutiny. The Union should not have a problem with the Manx people demanding 'independence'.After all, don't the reds love to 'break the chains'?"
CAN_channel_island_operations:0 "Channel the Loyalty of the Feudal Bastions"
CAN_channel_island_operations_desc:0 "The Channel Islands, closer to the communard menace than Britain itself, were always a loyal subject to the crown. At times difficult to defend from French aggression, these lands have long remained protectors of traditional English values. This is exactly why we are able to have a chance at seizing them back from the reds, especially if we call upon the bastion of feudalism and their Dame of Sark."
CAN_britain_surrounded:0 "The Sinking Ship Surrounded"
CAN_britain_surrounded_desc:0 "The bloodless 'coups' of various Unionist-occupied islands have been a tremendous success.

CAN_panama_canal:0 "Guardian of the Canal, Ruler of Two Oceans"
CAN_panama_canal_desc:0 "The Panama Canal is the nail in which hangs the rich tapestry of international shipping in the Americas.

CAN_british_honduras:0 "The Return of British Honduras"
CAN_british_honduras_desc:0 "In the chaos following the Disgraceful Revolution, our forces stationed in West Indies weren't able to hold every territory we possessed. That allowed the soldier thugs of José María Orellana to press their ridiculous claim and occupy British Honduras for Guatemala. What followed was continued oppression of the anglophone and native population, it's time to end that situation and return the colony to its crown."
CAN_west_indies_integration:0 "Integration of the West Indies Federal Project"
CAN_west_indies_integration_desc:0 "Owing to our temporary hardship in controlling every corner of our empire in peril, the West Indies were given a special autonomous status. This has helped them in integrating the disparate islands and combating the growing radical labour threat from the former French colonies there. With our position both in Canada and the Carribean restored the federal and distinct status of the Indies can finally come to a close."
CAN_miskito_coast:0 "The Third Protectorate over Miskito"
CAN_miskito_coast_desc:0 "Twice in their history, the natives of Miskitu had a gracious shield of Britian extend over their long land. Sadly for both of our peoples that came to an end during the closing years of the previous century. Since then, time and time again Nicaragua has proven itself to be both brutal and a failed state incapable of properly governing the Coast. Thrid time shall a protectorate over the Mosquito arise, for the benefit of all."

CAN_demand_falklands_desc:0 "Falklands, a place the outside world rarely hears or cares about. Many foreign diplomats have long wondered why would our government care about a resourceless rock an entire ocean away from Canada and Britian. Yet the Argie barging into our rightful territory is a matter of honor. It's a matter of their treachery, nay, their eternal shame. Argentina will pay, that is sure. No matter whatever it takes, the Falklands are coming home."

CAN_defense_one_desc:0 "Some years ago, military planners drew up several 'Defence Schemes' to deal with potential threats from America. This one details plans to fortify the border against incursion and occupy New England and Alaska to protect our flanks.

CAN_new_home_of_the_free:0 "New Home of the Free"
CAN_new_home_of_the_free_desc:0 "What an odd turn of events that it is Canada who now leads North America as the 'Home of the Free'.

CAN_frontline_of_redcoat_revenge_desc:0 "New England was not a goal in itself, it is merely a springboard. A first step in exacting our ultimate revenge upon the Judas of the British colonial empire.

CAN_pacify_new_england:0 "Three Strikes against Colonial Treachery"
CAN_pacify_new_england_desc:0 "We warned them during Mad King's reign, and yet they rebelled. We chased them to Boston just after the Intervention, and yet they persisted. Twice in their history, the New England colonial scum have rejected our generous hand. They bit their betters and thought the divine right of Britian to these lands was nought. They are sorely mistaken, treachery has to be struck down, even if it takes three times to make it right."

CAN_integrate_puerto_rico_desc:0 "The Right Honourable Lieutenant General Sir Ralph Abercromby was a true English hero, always ready to fight against the meddling Frenchman be he a royalist or a revolutionary upstart. Unfortunanetly, he wasn't as lucky when fighting the Spaniards in 1797. The expedition to Puerto Rico, while inflicting massive loses to the Spanish side, has cost him too and forced a withdrawal from San Juan. Over a hundred years later, we are in a position to finish Sir Abercromby's venture by putting the former American territory under our full control once and for all."
CAN_develop_puerto_rico:0 "The Riches of Saint John-upon-Piedras"
CAN_develop_puerto_rico_desc:0 "There is a reason why the Spanish conquistadors called the island a rich port. Puerto Rico is home to much treasure which would serve our nation well. It's time for new expeditions in their search to set out from the administrative capital of the isle, a city which many of our soldiers began to jokingly call Saint John-upon-Piedras as a reminder of naming conventions of our true home."

CAN_integrate_alaska:0 "Tear Up the Hay–Herbert Treaty"
CAN_integrate_alaska_desc:0 "The Hay-Herbert Treaty, signed less than four decades ago put an end to our dispute with the Americans over the Alaska-British Columbia border. Despite us being more than willing to respect the agreement till the end of days, the United States failed to do so on the account of their unity disintegrating. Having come into ownership of Alaska, we can simply nullify the treaty and redraw the border to reward British Columbia with their claims to Juneau and form a new legal entity from the remains of the former state."
CAN_develop_alaska:0 "Recompense for the Klondike Loses"

Indeed, it's true that they had to pay customs and stakes fees while additionally giving 20% of all the wealth they found to our government, much wealth was still lost to their hands. Our new territory in Alaska is rich in hidden treasures of the earth and the sea, just waiting to be discovered as a repayment of the debt the American miners have accrued."

The situation became so dire that many locals began to call the region 'Rust Belt' alongside the more popular 'Red Belt' used by political pundits. The potential lying in the great factories of Detroit and similar places is still immense, just waiting to be harvested.

While our coalition partners in the Liberal Party will likely not sign off on much of the CCF platform, other chapters are significantly more likely to pass, such as the nationalization of transportation, communications, electrical power and other services, which we have convinced the Liberals as a smart investment to buy into these services at their current rock-bottom prices."

As the Exiles comprise a significant portion of our voter base, it definitely wouldn't hurt to codify stronger property rights into law to ensure their votes in future elections, and make it more difficult for the CCF to implement their Manifesto which is dangerously close to Syndicalism."

The Conservative government, in an attempt to make the exiles as comfortable as possible, has begun embracing this British cultural revival to its full extent, heading the push for many of Britain’s cultural amenities to be implemented in Canada.

canada.1.t:0 "The Current Situation"
canada.1.d:0 "It has been ten years since the collapse of the United Kingdom in 1926 and, in that time, the king, the remnants of the British government, and over a million of the Empire's best and brightest (and wealthiest) have fled to Canada... with the clear expectation that an invasion would soon be launched to take back the Home Isles from the syndicalist upstarts. It quickly became evident, however, that the syndicalist position was stronger than anticipated. Early forays were rebuked, and the last decade has seen the Union of Britain become solidified and entrenched, to the point where we have had to adopt the Blue Ensign as the Red Ensign was too similar to the Unions. The Exiles, as they're called in Canada, have meanwhile been left adrift, determined to take back their homeland but facing the political reality that this may never happen."
canada.1.a:0 "One day soon, though!"

canada.2.d:0 "While initially welcomed with open arms by Canadians, the notion this might be a long-term arrangement has been an increasingly unpleasant one. Fingers were pointed and blame laid on those who were deemed responsible for the collapse and the subsequent inability to rectify matters, and resentment against Exiles who were seen as 'a higher class' in the Dominion as well as above the law has been growing. In 1931, a year after their election, the minority government of R.B. Bennett and his Conservatives collapsed, to be replaced by Mackenzie King and the Liberals with a promised focus on Canadian sovereignty and keeping the British government-in-exile at arm's length rather than acting as if nothing had changed in the relationship."
canada.2.a:0 "Only to be expected"

canada.3.d:0 "This year, Mackenzie King and the Liberals are nearing the end of their term and, on top of the tribulations of the Great Depression, there is growing criticism that little progress has been made in resolving the political situation. George V lies on his deathbed, charging the Exiles and the Conservatives with bringing the Empire 'back on track'. The old King is too apathetic to clash with the government, however his son and heir Edward clashes often with the Liberals, and the Canadian public appears split between those who would see matters come to a head and those who would prefer to abandon their ties to the crown and the French exiles in Africa both. The upcoming election appears as if it will be the most divisive in Canadian history."

canada.3100.t:0 "The Heir Apparent"
canada.3100.d:0 "The British Revolution has had quite the toll on our beloved King George V. The fall of the British Isles to Syndicalism was enough to make the King, who had previously considered himself a reformer, consider abdicating the Throne. While the King ultimately decided against it, refusing to abandon his subjects in their darkest hour, the King withdrew from public affairs, pushing for compromise with several concessive governments to ‘keep the peace’. With the King withdrawing, his son, Prince Edward, has taken up many of the King’s duties, establishing himself as a charming and likeable public figure which both Francophones and Anglophones can feel pride in. Despite this, Edward has shown himself to be much more uncompromising in the realm of Political Affairs, and many predict that Edward will come to clash with the Government of Mackenzie King once his father eventually comes to pass. Regardless of political matters, the King has shown himself to be dutiful, stoic, and unyielding in the face of Syndicalist Tyranny. Edward, despite being the first British King who will not be crowned as King in the halls of London’s Westminster Abbey, is determined to be the last."

His eldest son and heir apparent, Prince Edward, has inherited the throne as Edward VIII and is expected to address the nation within the month.

There the Archbishop of Canterbury, himself a British exile, performed the rites as expected by tradition, with a throng of media paying close attention to every move. Rather than making his first public appearance afterwards on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, King Edward instead appeared on the balcony of Rideau Hall, the official royal residence, where he was greeted by a throng of entusiastic Canadians."

Recently, however, there have been indications that Prime Minister Douglas Hogg's time is up. Hogg has served diligently as Prime Minister in Exile ever since the death of his predecessor Arthur Balfour, however the aging Viscount is looking for a window to retire. The King and Hogg have agreed that with the incoming liberation of Britain, a new face for the Exiles is needed. We could push the king to appoint a more moderate candidate, however - someone more likely to work with the Canadian government. We could also urge the king to appoint a candidate chosen by the Exiles in Canada, though how much of a legal mandate that would give the new Prime Minister is questionable.

Edward VIII accepted the resignation and later this day, and is considering options for a new prime minister of government in-exile. The most influential candidate is Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax, previously considered for the job but ultimately rejected by the Exiles, the other major candidate considered is Neville Chamberlain, half brother of Austen Chamberlain, who is widely blamed for causing the British Revolution. The final possible choice is Anthony Eden, a young up and comer who has rapidly risen through the ranks of the British Government in Exile.\n\n Regardless of who is chosen for the post, real governmental power still lies in the hands of Canadian PM [GetPrimeMinister]"

canada.81.t:0 "Fate of Exile Voting Rights"
canada.81.d:0 "Since the British Revolution drove them from their homes, the almost 5 million British Exiles which reside in Canadian Territory have had a complicated status within Canada society. Despite living in Canada and being immersed in Canadian society, these exiles are not classified as Canadian citizens, but rather as citizens of the United Kingdom who happen to inhabit Canada temporarily; just until their homes can be restored. Of course, this status was afforded at a time when we all were sure that the Syndicalist uprising would be squashed before we could finish a cup of tea; however almost 20 years have passed since the British Revolution by this point, and many of the Exiles have grown uppity about their lack of official status within the Kingdom of Canada. Indeed, the Exiles can not vote, do not enjoy the same rights awarded to Canadian citizens, and are still classified as ‘foreign nationals’. While many politicians say that the Exiles more than make up for their lack of official citizenship with their wealth and status, the many blue-collar and working class exiles who fled to escape the Syndicalist ‘red terror’ have protested their inability to vote. Since they are not permitted to vote in Canadian elections, and since the British Government in Exile holds no elections currently, these lower class exiles are left without a voice, and are thus powerless in governmental affairs. Of course, allowing the Exiles to directly participate in Canadian Elections would surely tilt the balance of power in favour of the Conservatives due to the aristocratic nature of the Exiles, something we can not allow; but perhaps a middle ground could be met by allowing Exiles to vote in their own independent elections. While legal experts question much of a legal mandate a government elected entirely on foreign shores would enjoy, holding elections within the Exile community would surely be a small pyrrhic victory, and show the Syndicalist Autocrats our true commitment to parliamentary democracy. Of course, these elections would only serve to elect Britain's Prime Minister in Exile, a mostly ceremonial post by this point."

Firstly, there is current Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM], a loyal member of the Tories who happen to make up the bulk of the largely aristocratic Exile population. Of course, those who could afford to flee fled, along with their wealth and increasingly anti-leftist political affiliation; leaving Labour (now rebranded under MacDonald as ‘National Labour’ and the Liberals in the dust in terms of popularity among the exiles. Of course, voting trends among the Exile Community are influenced by Canadian politics, with many of the lower and middle class exiles coming to support the Liberals or the CCF, and their equivalents in Exile politics, the Liberals and Labour. Perhaps the Liberals under Archibald Sinclair or National Labour under Malcolm MacDonald could edge out a win against the Tories, increasingly seen as responsible for the revolution within their own community."

The second to the last Prime Minister of the United Kingdom before the Revolution, MacDonald leaves a complicated legacy behind. To many it was MacDonald who worked so tirelessly to prevent Britain to succumbing to the same fate as France, ultimately failing in his mission due to Conservative and Liberal sabotage, in the eyes of others, it was MacDonald’s reckless cooperation with radicals that landed the Syndicalist revolution right on our doorstep. MacDonald has defended both his own and Labour’s performance in the years before the Revolution, pointing to how he attempted to root out radical Socialists within the party at every step, compromising across the aisle to help defend the interests of the British People. This action gained him the scorn of many within the party, ultimately leading to Labour splintering into two competing factions once the revolution arrived, with one faction fleeing into exile in Canada, and the other remaining as part of the new ‘Union of Britain’. Being one of the few Labourites not to stay behind in the new, Syndicalist Britain, MacDonald continued to command Labour from exile; eventually rebranding the party as the ‘National Labour’ party.\n\n MacDonald was greatly affected by death of King George V, a personal friend who considered him his favourite Prime Minister, with MacDonald paying tribute to him in his diary as "a gracious and kingly friend whom I have served with all my heart". MacDonald himself passed away on a sea voyage near Bermuda, recommended to MacDonald to restore his health. His body was moved to Bermuda on the nearest available Royal Navy Cruiser, where his body lied in state until being transferred to Ottawa for a proper funeral. He is succeeded as leader of the National Labour party by his son Malcolm, who vows to follow in his fathers footsteps in fighting for the Working Man without bending to Syndicalist Tyranny."

Many members of the government are saying the time has come to insist on Senate Reform, passing a law requiring Senatorial appointments be confirmed by the House of Commons.

The king's stance appears to be that 'in these troubling times' he cannot relinquish his royal prerogatives... so that likely means no reform will be possible. The king's actions have not endeared him with the Canadian public, however, as newspapers across the country have painted the king's actions as contemptuous of Canadian sovereignty and democracy."

The party's social democratic platform has resulted in accusations of it being funded and run by syndicalist sympathizers despite there being little to no evidence of this fact aside from baseless speculation concerning the CCF’s recent influx of exiles coming from the famously anti-Syndicalist British Labour party, but its message of alleviating the suffering of farmers and workers under capitalism has hit a chord even so. Regardless, its popularity seems most concentrated in Western Canada, and the idea that it might have a chance at forming a government is remote unless it is able to foster good relations with the Liberal Party over their shared appreciation of welfare economics and social justice so that a coalition may be formed. However, such a prospect seemingly becomes more possible by the day, which has frightened the Conservatives and their influx of exiled Tories, and has terrified the more radical monarchist and nationalist movements farther along the Right.

Whether Bill C-7 includes conscription, however, is the key element. French-Canadians in Québec are, in particular, vehemently opposed to the idea of general conscription forcing them to fight in a 'British war', and thus Liberal promises of not implementing it have seen them make great gains in that province. Conservatives, meanwhile, say that Canada doesn't have the manpower to fight any war without conscription.

Though the party initially failed to take root due to lack of support and funding as their rivals in the Absolutists jockeyed with them for members, the IUP has seen a recent uptick in membership and national popularity, curiously due to incoming funding and support from certain shady groups like the reactionary, ultra-royalist, anti-democratic group of esoteric neo-feudalists known as the English Mistery and the infamous and enigmatic clique of famed commander J.

The service proved invaluable in promoting loyalty throughout the British Empire, and also as a tool to marginalise syndicalism within our borders. There have been calls to install Reith as the head of the new Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in order to begin a propaganda campaign against more moderate socialists in the country.

Popularized and founded by the charismatic White Fox of the Kibbo Kift John Hargrave, the Kibbot Kift has long held links to the Social Credit Movement, with their unique brand of esoteric Eco-Rightism forming the basis of Social Credit’s naturalist and worldly sector. Rallying around the White Fox’s call of ‘We are the Green Shirts - indeed we are the Kindred - calling ourselves the Social Credit Party of Canada and the British Empire in Exile officially, but knowing full well who and what we are. Whelm on me ye Resurrected Men! I give you that Outcry of the Kin!’, the Kibbo Kift are among our greatest and most loyal allies. /n/nFamously, their mission was to further the belief that Kibbo Kift training would produce a core of healthy and creative individuals through whom the human race would evolve into a society without war, poverty and wasted lives. The Kibbo Kift held that individual character strengthened by mental discipline was the key to the future, not mass movements based on groups defined by class, race or nation states. However, many within our party do not fully agree with their wildly conservationist, environmentalist, scoutist, anti-modernist, and even semi-pagan ways due to Hargrave’s strange beliefs in natural magic, and as such, we must decide our official stance towards these Greens. We could allow them a great deal of power within the government, swinging Canada in a radically environmentalist and Green direction, or we could work to stymie their growing power.

canada.408.d:0 "As the fires of the Second American Civil War burn on, it is becoming increasingly clear that such a brutal conflict is not to end any time soon. Thus, if anyone within the Exiles had hoped that American aid could be used in the coming liberation, those dreams have been turned to ash, like so much of the American countryside. However, it does not have to be this way. In America's Deep South, the Constitutional American Republic fights for an America that shares many of the same ideals as ourselves. While outnumbered and seemingly outgunned, the Constitutionalists could make a very powerful ally should they prove victorious. Due to the nature of the Constitutionalist system, their enemies are many and international backers few, thus making them one of the weaker players in the Civil War. With us sharing much of the same basic ideological world view, us supporting them comes as no surprise. Many within our coalition have begun calling on the government to step up our support. Instead of just sitting and support them from the sidelines, these few want us to directly intervene in the civil war, to ensure a Constitutionalist victory. These same few have also called for us to occupy America's Red Belt, possibly directly annexing it, as the small cost for our aid in their victory. After all, the Constitutionalist government would be greatly indebted to us, and what better way to pay it back then by a small land grant?\n\nWhile gaining the American Red Belt would be a massive boon to us both in terms of population and resources, and it would be a good way to perfect our methods of de-syndicalization, there is no guarantee that the Americans would agree. Besides, is America really worthy that amount of blood it would take to end the war?"

Canada, in exchange for helping us bring an end to this horrid conflict, wants the Great Lakes as a land grand that is 'on lease for an indefinite  period.' In other words, in exchange for directly getting involved and helping put down the traitorous scum, Canada wishes for us to cede almost a fourth of the entire country. While in most times, such an 'offer' would be thrown out without consideration, these are desperate times. While yes, such a ceding of land would be that largest America has ever given away, we are fighting an uphill battle. We are surrounded on all sides, and internal enemies are just as vicious as those on the frontlines. Due to this, many within [root.getleader]'s government are genuinely considering such a proposal. Direct Canadian aid would not only all but ensure our victory, but could bring it even quicker. Besides, do we really want to deal with the insidious Reds when we could pass that cross over the Canadians? More radical members of this same camp believe America may very well be better as a nation without the Red Belt. The Red Belt has long been a hive of miscegenation, leftism, and immigrants. By ejecting them, our work to purify America becomes that much eaiser. Another option, besides rejecting it off hand, would be to offer to simply join the Entente. While much less in the favor of the Canadians, it would give them what they want, American resources to aid in the liberation of Britain. With the Canadian ambassador expecting a response any moment, we cannot keep him waiting."

Much blood will no doubt be splid in the coming weeks and mouths, but no doubt, it will be worth it.

While a far cry from what we asked for, this may be our only chance to ensure American backing for our war of liberation. Many, from the same camp that wanted us to demand the Great Lakes in the first place, wish for us to reject this offer, as something of a matter of pride. However, realists within the government thing we should take this deal, as while much of our own blood may be shed on American soil, American blood would be shed to free our home from Syndicalist tryanny.

canada.416.d:0 "Today, in a move long expected since His Majesty's making direct use of his vast royal prerogatives, [GetBritishExilePM] has been dismissed as Prime Minster of the United Kingdom's government-in-exile. While these days the post is only a symbolic office to offer a public face for the Exiles, the position of Prime Minister is one that still carries great weight. Indeed, while political they may have little to no power, as public face of the Exiles, their words and deeds are greatly followed by the media, and thus reflect onto the Canadian public, be them Exile or not. With [GetBritishExilePM] being no fan of His Most Gracious Majesty and his flexing of his prerogatives, it is a reasonable move that such a man be removed from such an influential position.\n\nAs for his replacement, His Majesty handpicked two possible replacements, namely William Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook and Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere. Both men are well known to the King, as both lead respectable media empires. Indeed, nearly a third of the news that is published in Canada and the wider Empire goes through one of the two men's companies. Both men are also fairly friendly with the government of the King, although it would not be an exaggeration to call the Viscount Rothermere a die-hard loyalist, with deep ties to the United Empire League. The Baron Beaverbrook, for his part, has an incredible mind for logistics, being known for brining a vital and vibrant energy to any logistical problem he touches. Along with this, the Baron Beaverbrook is a native Canadian, being born in Ontario in 1879. Due to this, Aitken is seen by those close to King as a way to play to the Canadians that we are all in this together. Either way, by appointing of one of these two men, the King ensures that not only with a man who knows how to play the media, but practically ensures the support of a media empire. With his choices being limited to two, His Majesty elects to... "

canada.417.t:0 "Prime Minister's Office Replaced"
canada.417.d:0 "As the Nationalist movement within Canada becomes more impowered and popular by the day, it was enviably that this popularity would spread among the exiled British population that dwells among us. Indeed, various exile nationalist organizations that are nominally tied to their Canadian counterparts have exploded in popularity, with an estimated 47% of the Exiles belonging any one of these groups. With this being the case, and with His Majesty seeking to further entrench his allies, [GetBritishExilePM] has been formally dismissed as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom's government-in-exile. While these days the post is only a symbolic office to offer a public face for the Exiles, the position of Prime Minister is one that still carries great weight. Indeed, while political they may have little to no power, as public face of the Exiles, their words and deeds are greatly followed by the media, and thus reflect onto the Canadian public, be them Exile or not. With [GetBritishExilePM] being no fan of His Most Gracious Majesty and the rising Nationalists, it is a reasonable move that such a man be removed from such an influential position.\n\nWhom is exactly to replace the now dismissed the Prime Minster is something of a contentious topic within the King's court and the broader Nationalist movement. Even with this being the case, two figures have repeatedly been brought up as possible replacements, namely Anthony Ludovici and Major-General J. F. C. Fuller. Ludovici and Fuller both are influential and well known faces within the Nationalist movement, although of different sides. Ludovici, a philosopher by trade, is a devoted supporter and follower of English Mistery and it's message of practical neo-Fudealism. By appointing such a learned man, English Mistery would deeply enter the public conscious, a move that in future could lead to an even further increase of the King's powers. General Fuller, already one of the top men within the Military, is seen as something of a unity candidate. Besides being a top man to prepare the Exiles for the Reclamation War, Fuller would bring a more modern Nationalist mindset to the Exiles, as opposed to the radical traditionalism of Ludovici. On a personal note, Fuller is an avid believer in magic and the occult, something very well could put his government at odds with the Church.\n\nWhile both men are great picks in their own right, there is indeed a third choice to replace the Prime Minster. That choice being to simply leave the office vacant. After all, was it not the government of a Prime Minister that led to the fall of Britain in the first place? While such a move would be a radical step towards absolutism, it is the right of His Majesty to so. After all, who better to led the British then the man who was reared from birth to lead them?"

canada.418.d:0 "Today, in a joint statement from His Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, the Canadian Prime Minister's Office and the British Prime Minister's Office, the dissolution of the British government-in-exile along with the dissolution of the Kingdom of Canada was announced in a solemn ceremony. To replace them, the governments of both Canada and the UK are to be merged into a single entity. From a legal viewpoint, this transforms Canada from a Kingdom housing the royal family and the exiled government, into the legitmate continuity of the United Kingdom. Indeed, the dissolution of the UK's government-in-exile signals that at least some of it's rightful land has been reclaimed, and thus normal governance can return. To many, this is also the start of an Imperial Federation, long the dream of many within the Empire.\n\nWhile the process of actually merging the governments will take some time, the most pressing question is exactly who is rule the restored UK along with the King.\n\nFrom a strictly legal standpoint, [GetBritishExilePM] is the current Prime Minster, and even with the merging, is to remain at their post. However, many close to the King have proposed dismissing the Prime Minster and replacing them with Adrien Arcand, whom has dutifully served the King as Prime Minister of Canada up until this point. By appointing Arcand, these members of the King's court say that it would make the transition easier, as having one of their own leading the entire Empire would no doubt make the pill easier to sallow. A smaller section of this same group agrees on all points, save the man to lead. To them, having a Frenchman led the Empire is paramount to treason. Instead, they propose John Ross Taylor, a proper Anglo-Canadian. Taylor, having many of the same ideals of Arcand, broke with him over the issue of race and is seen by many as a more moderate face in the Nationalist movement.\n\nWith the merging of the two states becoming more and more of a reality each passing hour, His Majesty must soon pick a man to lead this complex process."

Much time has passed from then, and while all know that the Prerogatives are here to stay, many wonder exactly how long that is. When he first made use of them, His Majesty made no declaration that such an act was only temporary, yet many Canadians are beginning to think that when Britain has been reclaimed, the Prerogatives shall be laid down, and Canada's democratic traditions may once again flourish. Due to this belief, many Canadians have accepted the status quo, however not all have. Many Canadians, mostly former members of parliament, have approached the King and have asked him to formally declare that, once Britain has been liberated, Canada shall return to normalcy. Interestingly enough, certain members of the Exiles, among them many within the so-called English Mistery, have called for the King to increase his use of the Prerogatives. In fact, this group has pressed the King to formalize dissolve Canada's government, reinstating direct British rule, which as King of the United Kingdom, an entity that nominally has authority over Canada, meaning that the King could dissolve Canada without issue. By doing this, His Highness could also be seen as implementing the first steps of an Imperial Federation, a goal that is considered to be the logical end point of the entire colonial project. With two radically different proposals, with heavy backing towards both, His Majesty has been put in corner.

While the ideas may indeed follow the Exiles' home, under current British Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM], only the old model of Capitalism will follow the wake of the Liberation. That is, unless His Majesty acts. A growing number of Exiles have petitioned the King to dismiss [GetBritishExilePM], replacing him with C. H. Douglas, founder of the Social Credit movement, himself. While something of a radical move, due to the current crisis of Exile, the King can dismiss and appoint the Prime Minister as he wills. Douglas, for his part, appears to be willing to serve in this capacity. Despite this, Douglas is far from a true politician, preferring to focus on economic matters.

As such, they suggest the eclectic environmentalist, Social Credit fanatic, and pagan scout John Gordon Hargrave - noted as a British Far-Right personality and as the founding figure and so-called Head Man and White Rabbit of his outdoorsman and handicraft group the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift. \n\nAfter serving as a medic in the Great War for the British Empire, and after witnessing the British Empire not only lose the war, but then collapse a few years later in the fires of foul Socialist revolution, Hargrave became a devoted pacifist and Utopian thinker, further dabbling in both the natural sciences and a variety of witchcrafts and magics. Despite these oddities, Hargrave has long been attributed to the Social Credit movement, helping to bring fame and recognition to our party as a loyal adherent and party member for years, and notable friend of many within the government. A pioneering expert on Woodcraft, a veteran scout leader and trained combat medic, a devoted druidic pacifist, and ‘an author, cartoonist, inventor, lexicographer, artist, and psychic healer’ as stated in his own words, Hargrave is a divisive and esoteric figure with a legion of fanatical young men zealously loyal to his ideas and strange way of life, but he may be the perfect man to lead Britain under our wing, if we can control him."

Together, we will build a healthy and creative humanity, perfect and free from disease, obesity, laziness, racism, ethnic and cultural prejudice, and rampant industrialism.

With the Danes gone, Canada has been elevated to the status as protectors and overlords of the island, and already a Entente friendly government has been appointed to serve in our stead.

canada.664.a:0 "Excellent."

canada.665.t:0 "Iceland Looks to Britain"
canada.665.d:0 "Sadly, the Icelandic nation has refused to use common sense, and has refused our demands for submission. The Icelandic government now look to the Union of Britain for protection, ironically bringing the threat of Syndicalism right to our doorstep. Do we abandon our pride and allow Iceland to wriggle free, lest the Syndicalists land on the island’s rocky shores, or do we crush these crypto-Syndicalists and prevent then UoB from gaining a hold in the North Atlantic."

canada.666.t:0 "Canada Stands Down"
canada.666.d:0 "Canada, being taken back by our threats of bringing in the Union of Britain, has stood down, allowing our nation to remain as independent and neutral.

canada.666.a:0 "Phew."

canada.667.t:0 "British Demands"
canada.667.d:0 "Our demands for support from the Union of Britain have come with strings attached, as the government in London have said that support for our nation is conditional on appointing an Internationale Friendly government. Whether a Syndicalist government is a price worthy of paying for our freedom remains to be seen."
canada.667.a:0 "We can't afford to be Picky."

canada.668.t:0 "The Syndicalists Take Iceland"
canada.668.d:0 "Reacting to our demands for submission, the Icelandic government has turned to the Syndicalist Union of Britain for support. The newly Syndicalist Icelandic government now has the backing of the Internationale dogs, making the task of quickly securing the demilitarized island nearly impossible without starting another Great War. Perhaps we should have been kinder to the Icelandic Delegation? "

entente.56.d.5:0 "Recent public sentiment in [Root.GetNameDef] has been turning towards the cause of the British Exiles, with the Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] conducting several interviews on [Root.GetAdjective] national radio which have painted the Homecoming as a cause that cannot be given up on just yet.

Seeing as the family was once considered an integral part of King [CAN_king_first_name]'s inner circle, the fortunes of the British Exiles have surely been hurt by this parting."

As the nominal head of the Church of England, which does not permit the divorced to remarry with a living former spouse, this is clearly unacceptable for the king. The [From.GetAdjective] Prime Minister has reached out to the [Root.GetAdjective] government for advice: is upholding British tradition worth the possible disruption to the Empire an abdication could entail?"

entente.104.d:0 "As the crisis surrounding his engagement to Constance Bennett deepened this week, with several members of his own Privy Council calling on him to either rescind his promise or abdicate the throne, King Edward today made a public plea via the [Root.GetAdjective] national radio to the people of the British Empire. In his broadcast, the king avowed that his love for Constance was true - as is hers for him. Neither of them sees Constance's current marriage as an impediment, and what's more the king believes that in these 'modern times' the prohibition of the Church of England should alone keep him from serving his people in good faith. With the crisis shortly to reach a high point in Parliament, it remains to be seen whether the king's attempt to garner goodwill with the public will bear fruit."

With so much public pressure on the government, it seems impossible that the king could be expected to abdicate his throne now. As a result, a hastily-drawn up decree from the Church of England has been issued offering Constance Bennett clemency... when and if the royal wedding should take place. Loyal citizens throughout the country reacted with joy, and newspapers ran headlines with a photo of King Edward and 'Queen' Constance embracing each other for the first time in public."

A special decree for clemency has been issued by the Church of England, offering clemency for Constance Bennett when and if the wedding takes place. The public is ill at ease with this result, and newspapers across the country have declared that it renders the monarchy itself illegitimate."
entente.106.a:0 "But Edward is still the king, yes?"

entente.107.t:0 "The Question of Abdication"
entente.107.d:0 "The question of King Edward's abdication has come to a fore. Seeing as the king refuses to abandon his engagement under any circumstances, the [Root.GetAdjective] government must now decide: should he be forced to abdicate the throne? Edward has indicated his willingness to step down, if the government should force his hand, though he says he will do so regretfully... and with great concern for the Empire's well-being. Others are less concerned about the fate of the Empire, though the king does still have supporters throughout the country declaring their ardent support for the king in his time of crisis."

Prince Henry is considered a biddable man, and has military experience that would be of great use. Prince George, meanwhile, is the youngest but is charismatic - and already has a son, to ensure a future king to follow him."

King Edward is the nominal head of the Church of England, an institution which does not permit a divorcee to remarry, and thus the scandal of such a marriage was too much for many. Even so, the king's popularity in the Empire has won the day.

The king happily waved to gathered [From.GetAdjective] citizens, all of whom were enthusiastic to see the sovereign on [From.GetAdjective] soil once more.

entente.300.t:0 "Co-Operation with the Entente?"
entente.300.d:0 "Many of our military experts believe our war against the Third Internationale will be a difficult one to win without some additional force applying pressure to the syndicalists. Fortunately, the experts in [From.GetNameDef] appear to agree. They have suggested that we meet with leaders from the [From.GetFactionName], now that they are also at war with [FRA.GetNameDef], and discuss the possibility we might work together. An alliance is out of the question, of course. What is the question is how much their co-operation is worth, considering they must fight the syndicalists anyhow."
entente.300.a:0 "Let us meet - we'll help them however we can"
entente.300.b:0 "We don't need their help"

entente.301.t:0 "Germany Refuses to Talk"
entente.301.d:0 "The Germans apparently believe they don't need our help, or they think talking is worth little since we have to fight the syndicalists anyhow. Whatever the reason, they have declined to meet with us to discuss co-operation. The idea is done before it began."
entente.301.a:0 "Ah well"

entente.302.t:0 "Germany Agrees to Talk"

While it is currently unclear how far such 'co-operation' would go, it seems worth the attempt. A representative from [This.GetNameDef] has been asked to attend."
entente.303.a:0 "We'll be there!"

entente.304.t:0 "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference"
entente.304.d:0 "Leaders from the Entente and the Reichspakt gathered in [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] today in order to discuss the possibility of co-operation in the war against the Third Internationale. What this co-operation would consist of was not difficult to ascertain: military and naval access between all members, but - more importantly, for the Entente - the willingness on the part of the Reichspakt to stay out of both France and Great Britain once the war is done. This would allow for a swift return to Europe for the French and British exile governments, the ultimate goal of both, but now a single question hangs over the conference: would [GER.GetNameDef] even agree to such terms, and if so what would they ask in return?"
entente.304.a:0 "That's an excellent question"

entente.305.t:0 "Our Demands"
entente.305.d:0 "Staying out of both France and Great Britain in the peace conference following our future victory would mean [GER.GetNameDef] walking away from a long and costly war with little to show for it - and possibly two restored neighbors who we have vanquished previously and who have no reason to be fond of us. We cannot rely on their gratitude... so do we even consider the idea? What do we ask for in return?"
entente.305.t.return:0 "Do We Demand More?"

entente.306.t:0 "The Conference Goes Nowhere"
entente.306.d:0 "It appears it was barely worth the delegates even coming to [ENT.GetConferenceLocation]. While the Germans initially appeared willing to talk, the idea of completely staying out of both France and Great Britain didn't appeal. They claimed they would come out of a long and costly war with nothing to show for it, and none of the delegates could convince them anything the Entente would part with would be worth their while. The delegates from the Reichspakt are already returning home, and the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference has been deemed an utter failure."
entente.306.a:0 "They asked for too much!"
entente.306.b:0 "What a waste of time"

entente.307.t:0 "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Alsace-Lorraine"
entente.307.d:0 "The German delegates at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference have come up with a demand in exchange for their co-operation: that our government publicly renounce all future claims to Alsace-Lorraine. It's no surprise, really, and while there's nothing to stop us from re-claiming it after the war is done it will certainly appear like an illegitimate act. Our allies might not even support us in such an endeavour. Or perhaps the Germans just wish us to humiliate ourselves, to renounce something everyone knows is ours, for co-operation they probably need as much as we do."
entente.307.a:0 "We will never renounce Alsace-Lorraine!"
entente.307.b:0 "Very well, we agree"

entente.308.t:0 "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
entente.308.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the [NFA.GetAdjective] delegate has refused to give up their claim to Alsace-Lorraine - not even for the help they desperately need to return to the continent. They are too proud to give up a claim to something they cannot possibly hope to recover."
entente.308.a:0 "That's it for the conference, then"
entente.308.b:0 "We'll put this demand aside, for now"

entente.309.t:0 "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Renounces Alsace-Lorraine"
entente.309.d:0 "Shockingly, the [NFA.GetAdjective] delegates have agreed - after much discussion with the Germans - to publicly renounce their claim to Alsace-Lorraine... if the Germans agree to the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference's treaty of co-operation. Considering the humilitation involved for the French to do so, it speaks much of how much they believe the treaty will help their return to the continent."
entente.309.a:0 "That is a relief"
entente.309.b:0 "A sweet admission on their part"
entente.309.c:0 "We have little choice"
entente.309.e:0 "How unexpected"

entente.310.t:0 "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Mitteleuropa"
entente.310.d:0 "The German delegates at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference have come up with a demand in exchange for their co-operation: once we have returned to Paris, we will join Mitteleuropa - the German economic union. No doubt they wish to ensure they economically dominate us as we rebuild the country... though rebuilding would also go much more quickly with their assistance, it's true. Do we swallow this pill? It's not impossible that we could simply refuse once Paris is ours, though there will undoubtedly be consequences for doing so."
entente.310.a:0 "No, we will not surrender our independence"
entente.310.b:0 "Very well, we agree"

entente.311.t:0 "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
entente.311.d:0 "It seems the French will not even accept an offered hand of assistance, believing that membership in Mitteleuropa would allow us to economically dominate their country. And they are correct, of course. Surely they did not think we'd allow France to restore itself without us having some kind of control? Now we must ask ourselves whether this is worth ending the conference over."
entente.311.a:0 "It certainly is!"
entente.311.b:0 "No, we must press forward"

entente.312.t:0 "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Join Mitteleuropa"
entente.312.d:0 "The German delegation has demanded that [NFA.GetNameDef] agree to join Mitteleuropa, the German economic union, after Paris has been regained. Most present at the conference believe the Germans intend to have some form of economic control over the French as they rebuild their country, but possibly their offer is benign. Whatever the motivation, the French have agreed: when the time comes, they will join Mitteleuropa as requested."
entente.312.a:0 "Ah, good"
entente.312.b:0 "We'll believe it when we see it"

entente.312.e:0 "Interesting"

entente.313.t:0 "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Our Former Colonies"
entente.313.d:0 "The German delegates at the conference have a demand: essentially, that the British and French colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia which Germany gained after the First Weltkrieg be recognized as theirs. It's a symbolic move, perhaps, but the Germans would like to forestall any attempts on our part to re-establish our old empires in those regions once our power is regained. That we would even be prepared to go to war for our far-flung colonies is hard to imagine, but - even so - the idea of abandoning them completely does sting."
entente.313.a:0 "We will not abandon our colonies"
entente.313.b:0 "They have already been lost"

entente.314.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
entente.314.d:0 "Interestingly, even though the British and French colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia have been lost for decades, now, [From.GetNameDef] has still refused to let them go. They would be 'abandoning' their former charges, as they see it, and will not relinquish even their moral claim to their colonies. Now we must decide whether this is enough to end the conference over. It is not, after all, like their refusal to recognize our colonies means they are any less ours."
entente.314.a:0 "Clearly they do not want co-operation enough"
entente.314.b:0 "It was a minor matter - let's move on"

entente.315.t:0 "German Colonies Recognized"
entente.315.d:0 "The French and British colonies gained by the Germans since the First Weltkrieg have been a sticking point - some annexed, others occupied 'temporarily' due to the lack of what the Germans claimed was a competent government to administer them. Now the Germans have demanded the colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia be officially recognized as theirs, forestalling future efforts to see them restored, and the Entente has agreed. It's a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but one that could prevent a great deal of conflict in the future."
entente.315.a:0 "It will be worth it"
entente.315.b:0 "Good"
entente.315.c:0 "Just get us to Paris"
entente.315.e:0 "Interesting"

entente.316.t:0 "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Northern Ireland"
entente.316.d:0 "The German delegates have done something unexpected: after discussion with their Irish allies, they have presented a demand from us - the British government must renounce future claims to Northern Ireland. It is no small thing, effectively annulling the Acts of Union and breaking apart the United Kingdom once and for all. Considering the Irish were never planning on relinquishing the land without a war, perhaps it is best that the question be settled now."
entente.316.a:0 "We won't be forced into this, not by Germany"
entente.316.b:0 "So be it, we agree"

entente.317.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
entente.317.d:0 "The British government has refused to give on the matter of Northern Ireland. Annulling the Acts of Union which created the United Kingdom, they say, is too large a matter to be decided here and now - the British delegates question whether they even have the authority to make such a promise. The Irish delegates are, of course, infuriated."
entente.317.a:0 "Too bad, we're done"
entente.317.b:0 "We won't end this for Ireland's sake"

entente.318.t:0 "The British Renounce Northern Ireland"
entente.318.d:0 "Today has caused much uproar at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: the German delegates, acting on behalf of their Irish allies, have demanded that the British renounce all claims to Northern Ireland. Even so it would annull the Acts of Union which created the United Kingdom, the British delegates have agreed to do so. They do not wish to war with the Irish, of all people, and while they have said the matter should in the end rest with the citizens of Northern Ireland themselves, they will not personally press British claims."
entente.318.a:0 "It had to be done"
entente.318.b:0 "I cannot believe they agreed to that"

The main terms of the deal involve both sides having military and naval access to the other, but - more importantly - [GER.GetNameDef] has agreed that, once the syndicalists have been beaten, they will take no territory in France or Great Britain and thus allow both the French and British exiled governments a swift return to Europe. Sources at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference say that the Germans elicited a host of promises from Entente leaders, though it remains to be seen whether - once the war is done, should they prove victorious - either side ultimately intends to keep them."

imp_fed.1.d:0 "Once but a dream of the British Colonial Project, since returning from exile, the British government has been seemingly working towards a realization of the unification of the entire Empire as a single nation state. Today, it appears that these rumors have proved correct, as the British government has formally invited our government to join them in the creation of an Imperial Super State. Promising a massive boon to the economy and national stability, the British have made it clear, that while we have ever right to refuse, they might not take no for an answer. In any case, with the Federation seeming closer every day, London is awaiting our response with baited breath."
imp_fed.1.a:0 "We have awaited this day, accept at once!"
imp_fed.1.b:0 "They must be joking? Such an entity would surely collapse overnight!"

imp_fed.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses our Proposal"
imp_fed.2.d:0 "Much to the dismay of many within the Colonial Office, [FROM.GetName] has refused to consent to joining the Imperial Federation. While an understandable decision, it would mean an end to the autonomy they have enjoyed since the exile, it is still something of a gutpunch, like a child rebelling against their parent. While normally, such an decision would be the end of our efforts, times have changed. His Majesty, nominally anyway, is the King of [FROM.GetName], who's authority is exercised and represented by a Governor-General. With this being the case, all it would take is a word, and [FROM.GetName]'s government could be dissolved, replaced by an appointed one, one that would consent where [FROM.GetLeader] and their government has not. While such a move would be a first of it's kind, the dream of the Imperial Federation, if we wish for it to be a reality, may just require it. Already, members of the Colonial Office have presented the King with a document which could make this decree a reality, all he has to do is sign, and the dream of an Imperial Federation is that much closer."  
imp_fed.2.a:0 "They shall be made to accept!"

imp_fed.3.t:0 "An End to Self-Government?"

Today, our Governor-General has moved to formally dissolve our government and replace it with one that shall go along with the Imperial Federation scheme. Coming to directly via royal decree, to the British, [root.getleader]'s government technically no longer exists. While legally, such a move is well within the right of the King to make, in flies in the face of true British values. In an attempt to make the transition somewhat easier, the Governor-General has not gone public with this order, hoping to simply have the government resign to avoid an even larger sandal. Due to this, many within the cabinet, and even [root.getleader] themselves have considered not resigning, and declaring independence from Britain. While such an action would be radical, it would perhaps be the only way to ensure that our sovereignty remains."

We obusivoly cannot allow such an isult to go unpunished. Already, the Royal Navy has been prepped for the journey, and sereval areas to make landfall have been charted.

After years of attempts, doubters proclaimed we would never birth a united Imperial state, but we have. The dream and logical end point of the colonial project has been met, and every single Brit, from Ottawa to London, from Kingston to Sydney, is united in a single state. Where there was once doubt and depression within the hearts of Imperial citizens, a new hope for the future has arisen. The Empire, almost wiped out in 1925, has truly striked back on to the pages of history, and the return of the Empire shall never again be doubted. While integration proper will take decades we shall face the challenges it poses as one, with no division between us as a people. The Imperial Federation is at last a reality, and with God on our side shall never fall. We will no doubt face many challenges ahead, but for now we can rest, knowing our work is nearing competition."

Coming following years of struggle to reclaim their home, the British exiles, merging their Empire in this fashion, are completing what they call the logical endpoint of British Colonialism, that being the unification of the Empire itself into a single entity. With this Federation's creation, many are wondering what is next for the British Empire, now one. Even more are wondering, perhaps more importantly, just how long can an entity this large, this spread out, can actually survive. If this Imperial Federation proves to be the next step in British global domination or a failed national experiment, remains to be seen."

acw_peace.1.t:0 "A United Front Against the Syndies?"
acw_peace.1.d:0 "As the Civil War drags ever onwards, many have begun to fear that the conflict for the soul of America, having already dragged on for so long, may simply continue indefinitely. Enemies remain on all sides, and it seems every time a breakthrough is made, the gap is closed all the sooner. However, it seems that an opportunity to finally end this war may have materialized. The Canadians to our north, whom have recently reclaimed the British Isles, have approached each faction with a proposal to finally end this bloody conflict. Seeming to think that their liberation of Britain has made them the new world power in North America, Canada has brought forth a two-step peace plan, to restore America to a state of peace and unity. Firstly, each faction shall enter into a ceasefire, with the exception of the damned Syndicalists. Each surviving faction shall focus down the Syndicalists, while ceasing to fight each other. Once the beast of Syndicalism is put down, part two of the peace plan can beguin.  A national referendum shall be held to decide by popular vote which faction shall rule America, and which shall receive Canadian recognition. The referendum will be organized by Canadian peacekeepers, as to avoid any tampering with the results. Canada also made barely-vailed threats, that should the peace process fail, they would bring about peace by force of arms.\n\nWhile a novel proposal, and perhaps the quickest way to end this bloody conflict, there is no telling the actual chances of success. For while we are all Americans, we have been behind trenches so long that many would rather forget that. Be that as it may, a chance to just put down the dogs of the Combined Syndicates may give us the edge we need to finally win this war, thus some think we should agree to this peace process, until we can get the upper hand on our enemies. With the nation still in wartime, such an important decision falls to [root.getleader] to make."
acw_peace.1.a:0 "Very well, we shall have peace, at least for now."
acw_peace.1.b:0 "Bah! The Canadians have a snowball's chance in hell to end this war!"

acw_peace.2.t:0 "The Fate of Peace"
acw_peace.2.d:0 "With the rabid dogs of the CSA finally put down, the Canadian government has moved to begin Phase Two for their plans for an American peace. In short order, Canadian peacekeepers shall flood south, setting up voting booths in conjunction with local governments. In but a short time, this senseless conflict shall be over, the referendum shall take place and America will be reunited, at least in theory. Many within [root.getleader]'s government have begun calling for a renewing of hostilities with the other factions, attacking when they least expect it. In an effort to avoid being called oath breakers, this faction in the goverment says we can frame this renewly by stating we only agreed to putting down the Syndies, nothing else. By framing it this way, we can avoid international repercussions, or so they claim anyway. While we may have gained somewhat of a better position with the downfall of the Red Belt, many doubt if it's truly a good enough position to actually win the war. Besides, we are this close to having peace in our time, is plunging the nation back into war really worth it?"
acw_peace.2.a:0 "We have come this far, our fate lies with the people now."
acw_peace.2.b:0 "We can end this war now, begin preparations to resume the conflict!"
