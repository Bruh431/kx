#Leader Descriptions#

POLITICS_TASHI_NAMGYAL_DESC:0 "Crowned by the Dalai Lama in 1914 after the death of his half-brother, His Highness Sri Panch Maharaja Tashi Namgyal, Maharaja Chogyal of Sikkim, is the undisputed sovereign of the Kingdom of Sikkim. Born in Tibet in 1893, Tashi is only the most recent ruler in a dynastic line that has lasted since 1642. Nominally an absolute monarch, Tashi has infamously begun a crusade to reform and liberalize Sikkimese society, but this has come into conflict with the desires of the conservative nobility. Though he receives tacit support from more radical elements, many fear that the king may not be able to go far enough to truly modernize the archaic state of Sikkim, and so the 11th Chogyal walks a razor's edge here at the top of the world as he seeks to bring prosperity to this paradise amid the mountains."
POLITICS_JERMAN_LEPCHA_DESC:0 "Standing as the face of the radical reformist movement called the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha, Jerman Lepcha is the unity figure that binds the various reformist, liberal, and vaguely Socialist groups that seek a modern and prosperous Sikkim free of the nobility and the monarchy. Born in 1910, this young firebrand has waged a mostly peaceful, non-cooperative protest campaign against the deep-rooted and oppressive aristocracy, and now stands as the progressive savior of Sikkimese democracy. Seeking to bring agrarian-minded, Socialist-inspired total societal reform to this archaic land, Sikkim shall never be the same as Jerman guides it and his people towards a uniquely-Sikkimese modernity."
SKM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "An absolute monarchy since 1642, the Kingdom of Sikkim stands at the crossroads of empires. Once part of the now defunct Raj, Sikkim has survived Nepali, Bhutanese, and Indian ambitions thanks to its ally to the North in Tibet. However, with the Qing beginning to disintegrate, Tibet’s military will be preoccupied elsewhere, leaving Sikkim vulnerable as the reform-minded king of Sikkim, seeks to begin a massive liberalization and modernization initiative in order to raise his people out of feudalist serfdom. However, with nobles holding him back, and with radicals threatening revolution if he does not go far enough, Tashi is caught in the middle of competing forces as he tries to guide his nation across this treacherous tightrope and into prosperity."

#Ideas#
SKM_ethnic_tensions:0 "The Chaotic Melting Pot of the Himalayas"
SKM_ethnic_tensions_desc:0 "Despite our tiny size, Sikkim is a land of diversity and ethno-religious friction. Between Hindus and Buddhists, our people cannot agree on matters of spirituality, and with bickering ethnic groups always chomping at the bit, our nation suffers from societal schisms. From the dominant Lepchas that control the monarchy and the South, to Limbus and Magars along with Tibetic speakers of the North, to the masses of Indians hailing from various ethno-linguistic groups, and even with the stray souls from China and Bhutan, our nation is at the crossroads of cultures, languages, religions, and empires, and this has turned us into the little melting pot of the Himalayas, for better or for worse. Regardless, these schisms must be mended if our Kingdom is to survive the relentless dawn of modernity."
SKM_archaic_economy:0 "An Archaic and Feudalistic Reality"
SKM_archaic_economy_desc:0 "It is no secret that Sikkim is not an economic superpower. Sikkim isn’t even a regional or local power, and this harsh reality blatantly and painfully shows across the nation. Much of our people live their lives as poor peasants, working fields and paying tithes to the nobility in a feudal system that has existed for centuries. If Sikkim is ever to reach modernity and prosperity, drastic changes must come to our ‘Secret Land of Rice’ among the Himalayas."
SKM_obsolete_army:0 "Archaic Armed Forces"
SKM_obsolete_army_desc:0 "To call the armed forces of Sikkim an army would be a gross overstatement. Aside from the palace guard and police forces employed by the government and by influential families and groups like the Kazis, the bulk of our forces are composed of peasant militias drafted, oftentimes against their will, to defend the nation. Utilizing archaic tactics and wielding medieval weaponry aside from the few firearms in our possession sourced from India, Tibet and the British or created in primitive gunsmithies, this pre-industrial rabble has much to do before it can be considered a true army fit to defend Sikkim in this modern age."
SKM_not_as_obsolete_army:0 "The Beginnings of a Modernized Army"
SKM_not_as_obsolete_army_desc:0 "Though there is still much to do, Sikkim’s once-backwards and largely peasant-based militia has begun to metamorphose into an organized national guard. With modern weapons, equipment, and tactics, we shall slowly pull the Valley of Paradise out of the Dark Ages and into the 20th Century."
SKM_modern_army:0 "Militarized Masters of the Mountain Paradise"
SKM_modern_army_desc:0 "Through intense reform and militarization efforts, imported supplies and the creation of meager domestic industries, and the overall modernization of the state, Sikkim is finally secured and defended behind a mostly modern army. Utilizing our rough terrain, experimental technologies, a mix of guerilla and European strategies, and the natural marksmanship taught to many as part of certain native cultures like the Lepchas all in syncretity with other advances in order to supplement our weaknesses, Sikkim’s army is ready to defend our beloved Paradise until the last soul."
SKM_landowning_elite:0 "Dominance of the Nobility"
SKM_landowning_elite_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Sikkim has been under the thumb of the nobility for centuries, and atop this hierarchy is the Namgyal Dynasty and the largest and most dominant aristocratic clan - the Kazis. From forcing peasants to parade them around in palanquins to working their serfs to the bone in the fields, these blue-bloods rule with an iron fist gilded in gold, and with one hand in the national coffers at all times. However, the current Chogyal is noted for his desire to reform this reality, and from within the shadows, relatively peaceful Socialist revolutionaries clamor for their time to strike, egged on by foreign backers and united by the infamous Jerman Lepcha. The nobility may be dominant, but they walk a delicate tight-rope, and if they are not careful, these aristocrats may finally be pushed from their lofty position."
SKM_chogyal:0 "The 11th Chogyal, Maharaja of Sikkim"
SKM_chogyal_desc:0 "His Highness Sri Panch Maharaja Tashi Namgyal, Maharaja Chogyal of Sikkim, or Bkra-shis Rnam-rgyal, is the 11th Chogyal, or king, and current Maharaja of our paradise, ruling over both the Buddhist and Hindu populations as the one true ruler of the Kingdom of Sikkim. Succeeding his half-brother who died of heart failure in 1914 after only reigning for eleven months, Tashi has stood as the most powerful man in Sikkim for decades. Despite pushback from the nobility - and especially from the Kazis - Tashi is a reformer at heart. His dream for Sikkim is to create a fair and free parliamentary monarchy with himself at the helm, supported by a democratically elected council to aid him in matters of statecraft and beyond. However, this dream is far easier said than done, and the 11th Chogyal will have to be careful, for the scavenging leopards have already begun to circle the reformer king’s throne."

sikkim.1.t:0 "The New Year Dawns on Paradise"
sikkim.1.d:0 "Literally called paradise - Nye-mae-el - by the Lepcha, the dominant ethnic group of the nation, Sikkim is a beautiful and storied mountain refuge safe from the wider world, or at least, it was once isolated. Now, Sikkim has been held hostage in a diplomatic game of tug-of-war, for Sikkim sits at the crossroads of empires on this sliver of the mighty Himalayas. \n\nSikkim has been a monarchy since 1642, dominated by the Namgyal dynasty for over 300 years despite the rise of numerous other empires including the colonial behemoth of the British. A Buddhist family tied to the Lamas ruling over a multi-ethnic and multi-religious state is no easy task, but the Namgyals have managed to keep the Kingdom of Sikkim together for centuries. However, this legacy is now being tested more than ever. \n\nWhen the Raj fell in the wake of the British Revolution, Sikkim was one of hundreds of states to break free from the dying carcass of British Imperialism, but Sikkim now stands nearly alone as a post-Raj state free from the main Indian factions. This independence was not widely wanted outside our borders however, for Nepal, Bhutan, and what has now become the Bharatiya Commune have all tried to absorb our mountain kingdom. Their efforts have all been kept at bay due to the nation’s close ties with and guarantees of national sovereignty by Tibet, for the Lamas of Tibetan Buddhism and the royal family, as well as much of the nobility, have been closely linked for as long as the kingdom has existed. A nominal subject of the Qing, Tibet has been able to defend Sikkim’s independence, but with the wavering Manchu dynasty close to collapse, Tibet is no longer in any position to be able to waste troops guarding foreign borders. \n\nAs the Qing inch closer to collapse, the wolves that circle our kingdom only grow more bold, and soon our independence will surely be tested unless we do something first. It is up to the 11th Chogyal - or king - and Maharaja of Sikkim, His Highness Tashi Namgyal, to guide the nation through the fires of foreign diplomacy while dealing with the rising tides of radicalism and greater calls for reforms. Seeking to liberalize and modernize the nation despite pushback from powerful aristocratic families and groups like the Kazi, Chogyal Tashi must strike a balance and mend the schisms that divide Sikkim lest this paradise come to a burning end under the boots of foreign powers."
sikkim.1.a:0 "Sikkim, Kham-sum-wangdu!"

sikkim.2.t:0 "Tashi’s Gambit for the Reformation of Sikkim"
sikkim.2.d:0 "Chogyal Tashi has long desired to reform Sikkimese society in a major way, pushing for sweeping reforms to the educational system, the healthcare system, the judiciary, the nobility, the economy, and more, virtually rebuilding all of Sikkimese society from the ground up. These reforms would slowly see Sikkim transformed into a mixed-economy populist monarchy supported by a modernized, primarily agrarian industry, greatly expanded social and civil rights, and most groundbreaking of all - the end of the neo-feudal system dominated by the nobility through sweeping land reform and the creation of a true, democratically elected Sikkimese parliament. Modeled on the Indian Congress as well as from both the British and German systems, Tashi seeks to create a syncretic ideology formfit for Sikkim’s unique reality with the wellbeing of the masses as the key concern, earning him the nickname the People’s Chogyal. \n\nHowever, this reformation has one large and near-immovable obstacle - the nobility. Traditionalist, conservative, and resistant to change in most forms, these influential and affluent aristocrats may be subservient to the crown, but there is no secret they truly run Sikkim. If Tashi is to be able to push his desired reforms, he will have to break with most of them, losing him much support that would hopefully be replaced by the democratic and supportive voices of the masses, or he will be forced to heavily compromise his vision. Supporting Tashi, at least for now, is Jerman Lepcha and his band of radical liberal reformers in the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha - a band of peaceful reform-minded protestors pushing for the democratization and liberalization of Sikkimese society. However, though they are peaceful now, Jerman has sworn that should Tashi break his promises for effective reform, he and his growing band of followers will have no other choice than to take matters into their own hands. \n\nWith all this in mind, and with over two decades of ruling experience and preparation already behind him, it is finally time for the 11th Chogyal to decide the ultimate fate of his paradisiacal kingdom."
sikkim.2.a:0 "I am Chogyal, and what I say goes! The final reforms shall be begun!"
sikkim.2.b:0 "We must heed the word of the nobles. It’s not like the serfs will actually revolt."

sikkim.3.t:0 "The Peasant Coup"
sikkim.3.d:0 "With Chogyal Tashi bending to the whims of the spoiled nobility, Jerman and his SKM have decided to drop their pacifistic opposition, taking up arms across the nation in a hastily organized but well-prepared revolution. Using the mountainous terrain and lack of infrastructure or good communications to their advantage, the rebels have already seized the capital after slaughtering the Sikkim Guard garrisoning the royal palace. Though they took ten times the losses themselves, the peasantry have numbers on their side, and it would seem that all hope for the monarchy and the nobility it lost. Jerman Lepcha was true to his word, and with Tashi’s refusal to go through with his reforms, the Tigerslayer himself has risen to lead a new Socialist-inspired but largely non-radical republican government. The centuries-old reign of the Namgyal dynasty is finally at an end as the Sikkimese Revolution comes to a hasty end."
sikkim.3.a:0 "I guess the Chogyal was wrong."

sikkim.4.t:0 "Our Role in the Revolution"
sikkim.4.d:0 "Sikkim has come to embrace its new liberalized and socialized future, and under Jerman Lepcha, our mountain paradise has finally come to embrace its reformative future. However, with our collective now stable and progressing peacefully towards an equal and fair society for all true Sikkimese sons, our place in the wider international revolutionary struggle must be determined. \n\nOur allies and benefactors to the South in Calcutta have aided us greatly, but it is no secret that many within their ranks do not do so out of Socialist unity and camaraderie. The Indians have desired our Sikkim to meld into their borders since our independence was secured after the death of the Raj, and now that we are aligned and closer than we have been since the age of colonial rule, Calcutta has pushed heavily for our complete integration. However, we are a proud people with our own identity and history, and as such, Jerman has resisted this push, instead declaring that we must remain as independent, equal, but loyal allies to the southern colossus, safeguarding our sovereignty as we march together towards a truly prosperous future. With Calcutta pressuring us more and more, Jerman must decide the fate of Sikkim soon."

sikkim.5.t:0 "The First Sikkimese Elections"
sikkim.5.d:0 "Finalizing his sweeping reforms with the pinnacle of his planned liberalizations, Chogyal Tashi has begun to usher in true parliamentary democracy to our paradisiacal Kingdom of Sikkim. Though the king shall still be the absolute and final voice in any and all matters, this democratically elected civilian government will support Tashi as he seeks to further transform Sikkimese society. The main parties are less parties and more just groupings of interest groups within the royal court and among the peasantry - a sort of pro-multiparty democracy that will surely come to become more organized and distinct over time. Safeguarding tradition and resisting most reforms are nobility, who cling to the status quo. Slightly less of an obstacle to full reform are the various princes and monarchist loyalists sworn to Tashi, who desire some small, token reforms to preserve stability without any real changes to the status quo. Opposing these noble-centric groups are the varied reformist factions, which range from small landowners and merchants - our meager but growing middle class - who push for liberal and modernist reforms modeled on Western and Eastern democracies, to the radical peasantry who are split between more liberal-minded monarchists and the radical, Socialist-inspired forces of Jerman Lepcha’s SKM. Whichever faction wins out, Tashi shall still remain as the sole face of Sikkim, but whoever is chosen shall work with our Chogyal to guide Sikkim into its new and democratized future. With the votes being counted by Tashi and his aides themselves, the results are soon to be announced, and the winner shall be..."

sikkim.5.c:0 "The moderate reformists championed by our growing landowner class wins out."
sikkim.5.e:0 "The liberal reformists led by the non-radical peasantry secures a win."
sikkim.5.f:0 "The radical reformists of Jerman Lepcha seize the day."

sikkim.6.t:0 "The Lamas"
sikkim.6.d:0 "The Lamas of Sikkim are the highest level of the Buddhist clergy, second only to the Chogyal in influence, though the nobility frequently rivals this power. Spiritually guiding the nation from beautiful and ancient monasteries such as Rumtek, Dubdi, and Ralang, these disciples of the Buddha are Sikkim’s enduring link to their past and their cyclical future. Loyal to the crown and to the Namgyal dynasty as well as the Dalai Lama in Tibet, these clergymen usually put matters of the faith above all, and are frequently mediators and arbiters of conflict within the nation, safeguarding tradition while seeking to bring unity to the varied population. Under their guidance, Sikkim remains tied to its beliefs and its past, and together they help form the fabric of Sikkim’s varied society."
sikkim.6.a:0 "Our ties to the beyond."

sikkim.7.t:0 "The Aristocracy"
sikkim.7.d:0 "Sikkim may be led by the Chogyal, but its society and its people are dominated by the aristocracy. All across our mountain paradise, various influential, wealthy, and domineering noble families and interest groups dominate the peasantry. From forcing them to work the fields as serfs to even subjecting them to carry each noble around in a personalized palanquin, the nobility has held the Sikkimese peasantry under their thumb for centuries, enabling the persistence of a semi-Feudalist society that has stagnated and grown archaic as the rest of the world around us dashed towards modernity. Most powerful of all the noble groups are the Kazis, a group of affluent and highly influential noble contractors and princes poised as the traditionalist anchor of Sikkim. They resist any and all pushes for liberalization and modernization in order to safeguard their positions of power, and are largely led by Kazi Lhendup Dorjee of the Khangsarpa family. Young but fiercely dedicated to Sikkimese tradition, Lhendup leads the Kazis and other noble groups to stand as Chogyal Tashi’s largest obstacle to reform."
sikkim.7.a:0 "Our ties to the past."

sikkim.8.t:0 "The Chogyal"
sikkim.8.d:0 "The Chogyal, or king, of Sikkim has been a position for over 300 years, and has only been held by pure-blooded members of the Namgyal dynasty. Currently, the reformist-minded 11th Chogyal commands the nation, seeking to drive Sikkim towards modernity without losing sight of its storied past. Crowned by the Dalai Lama in 1914 after the death of his half-brother, His Highness Sri Panch Maharaja Tashi Namgyal, Maharaja Chogyal of Sikkim, is the undisputed sovereign of the Kingdom of Sikkim. Born in Tibet in 1893, Tashi is only the most recent ruler in a dynastic line that has lasted since 1642, but his rule is quite unique. Nominally an absolute monarch, Tashi has infamously begun a crusade to reform and liberalize Sikkimese society, but this has come into conflict with the desires of the conservative nobility. Though he receives tacit support from more radical elements led by Jerman Lepcha and his SKM, many fear that the king may not be able to go far enough to truly modernize the archaic state of Sikkim. With instability mounting and with the nobility and the peasantry more rowdy than ever, the 11th Chogyal Tashi Namgyal walks a razor's edge here at the top of the world as he seeks to bring prosperity to this paradise amid the mountains."

sikkim.9.t:0 "Sikkim Calls for Aid"
sikkim.9.d:0 "We have received a message from an envoy sent out by Tashi Namgyal, King of Sikkim, requesting aid and support in his endeavours in return for closer ties between our nations. Considering how this envoy must have trekked across the Himalayas with some of the most treacherous conditions present just to make deliver this message, some of our supporters believe Sikkim to be in true danger, and we must provide aid immediately. Others are still not convinced and see no reason to waste precious time and resource into such an irrelevant speck of land. What response shall we send the envoy back with?"
sikkim.9.a:0 "Namgyal shall have our full support!"
sikkim.9.b:0 "Begone, we have no need for Sikkim."

sikkim.10.t:0 "Sikkim Calls for Aid"
sikkim.10.d:0 "In a matter of strange circumstances, a diplomat under the orders of the King of Sikkim, Tashi Namgyal, has arrived in Delhi, expressing that the micronation that was once under our rule seeks out our aid against the Socialists creeping up upon them. This could be a good opportunity for us to limit the Red’s influence in the Himalayas further – if they were to conquer Sikkim, then Nepal would surely come next, and that is a risk that we cannot ignore. However, there is still much to do back in the Homefront, and Sikkim is certainly not going to be providing us with much of anything. How shall we respond?"
sikkim.10.a:0 "We can always spare a little help."
sikkim.10.b:0 "We are far too busy to send aid. Best of luck!"

sikkim.11.t:0 "Sikkim Calls for Aid"
sikkim.11.d:0 "One of the main goals of the Commune of France is to foster Syndicalism worldwide, to one degree or another, and often we get many diplomats, generals, and exiled politicians seeking financial and military support from us. However, today’s ‘guest’ is not an envoy, diplomat, or any person for that matter – it is in fact a letter from the faraway land of Sikkim, of whom wish aid in the form of supplies directly from us, to help foster their socialist cause. Many members of the foreign office, understandably, are hesitant. There is little to no news of this land, or the state of its people. Some in our government cannot even point to where it might be on the global map. For all we know, this can be all an elaborate hoax. However, we cannot allow a Socialist nation’s cry for help to go unheeded, out of our sheer principles. What is to be done?"
sikkim.11.a:0 "Very well, let’s hope this is not some reactionary plot to waste our time."
sikkim.11.b:0 "As if we would ever believe in a country called ‘Sikkim’!"

sikkim.12.t:0 "Sikkim Calls for Aid"
sikkim.12.d:0 "Once again, we have received a request from our tiny ally to the north requesting more aid in order to build its industry and military. For such a small nation, their request is easily doable. Let us just hope they put it to good use, one way or another."

sikkim.13.d:0 "Instigated by our foe to the north in the form of Sikkim of all places, Nepali Ghorkas in Darjeeling have begun to rebel against our rule en masse, rising up against us in order to bend the knee to the Kingdom of Sikkim! How this came about, we have no idea, but it is vital that we respond to this blatant act of war immediately!"

sikkim.14.d:0 "Against all odds, we have finally come out on top as the sole ruler of the Himalayas. With the Nepalese under our heel and the foolish Dragon King of Bhutan humbled, we have shown the world the true might that is Sikkim. However, none of this would have been possible without the guidance and wisdom of our beloved ruler. His vision for Sikkim does not end here however – now, he seeks to integrate the new lands under our flag as one nation, defined by the true faith of Buddhism. As his people rejoice, his subjugated subjects watch in horror. Only time will tell how this new powerhouse of Asia shall fare."

sikkim.15.t:0 "Uniting the Mountains"
sikkim.15.d:0 "After a long struggle, we have achieved the impossible; centuries of despotic rule have finally ended in the Himalayas as Jerman Lepcha addresses the hundreds of onlookers attend his celebratory ceremony in the centre of Gangtok. While the journey has been arduous for our people, with help from the Bharatiya Commune and sheer perseverance, we have emerged victorious. The peasantry shall now rule these mountains, as it rightfully should be, and it shall be done under a new flag, under a new nation, as one people!"

sikkim.18.t:0 "Sikkimese Raids!"
sikkim.18.d:0 "Reports have begun flurrying in of our trade routes and soldiers near the Eastern border being subject to savage raids from the neighbouring Kingdom of Sikkim. While there has been no word from the government of Sikkim, we are not blind. These bandits are not so foolhardy as to attempt to raid us on their own, whilst Sikkimese soldiers are conveniently looking away – it must be a provocation from Sikkim itself, to drag us into war. However, for such a minor nation, causing such a minor nuisance, it might not be such a bad idea as to stop them in their tracks in an act of overestimation." 
sikkim.18.a:0 "Show them the wrath of Nepal!"

sikkim.19.t:0 "Sikkimese Raids!"
sikkim.19.d:0 "An envoy has arrived with reports of gangs of Sikkimese thugs and bandits harassing farmers and troops stationed by our border with the Kingdom from which they arrive. With no word from the Sikkimese government that may justify this blatant disruption of peace, we can only presume the worst. As simply as it may seem for us to wipe out this proverbial housefly to the wind, it may be important to exercise caution. After all, they would not just raid us without a plan…right?"

Along with his brother Palden Thondup, he stands by his father’s side loyally as an honored friend and respected aid as well as a son. Seeking to bring further honor to his family while fulfilling a lifelong dream of flight, the Crown Prince attended an Anglo military school in Delhi in order to train to become a fighter pilot. Graduating with top honors and with hundreds of flight hours logged, Crown Prince Paljor is the greatest pilot to ever fly for Sikkim, and has since returned to Gangtok to serve as the new chief of the Sikkimese air force, tied to the functions of the Sikkim Guard. With Paljor defending our skies above as his father sits on the throne and guides the nation, the people of Sikkim can be sure that the Namgyals will keep them safe."

sikkim.17.d:0 "Rhoomo Lepcha - famed Sikkimese botanist, naturalist, and academic - has led a new botanical survey deep into the heart of the Sikkimese Himalayas in order to find new plant species for both ecological and medicinal study. Along with her is a small international group of botanists led by the German-American expert on plant anatomy Katherine Esau and the Japanese botanist and ethnologist Minakata Kumagusu, who specializes in fungal analysis while also having an interest in the local isolated minority groups within the mountain ranges of Sikkim. Together with other naturalists, this group seeks to further tap into the unknown and reveal more of the wonders our mountain paradise holds."

sikkim.20.t:0 "An Old Monument Made New"
sikkim.20.d:0 "Seeking to restore more aspects of both his own family’s legacy and the history of the Kingdom while also proving to the conservative nobility that he is still dedicated to tradition despite his reforms, Tashi Namgyal has utilized more of his personal funds to restore historic and spiritual sites across the nation, from various monasteries and burial sites to stupas and palaces. Most recent of his grand restorations was the total facelift of the Norbugang Chorten - the stupa created by the first Chogyal Phuntsog Nagmyal in 1642 after his coronation by the three highest Lamas in Sikkim at Yuksom. The sacred and serene Kuthok lake is also nearby and of great significance to the monarchy and to local Buddhists, and has become a common pilgrimage site as well thanks to Tashi’s renovations and funding. Sites like these and many others will continue to be renovated as the 11th Chogyal seeks to hold on to our storied past as he progresses to the future."

sikkim.21.t:0 "The Colossus of Sikkim"
sikkim.21.d:0 "The Colossus of Sikkim, Barmiok Athing Tashi Dadul Densapa is the loyal and ever-vigilant right-hand man to Chogyal Tashi. Formally, he is the Nyer-Tsang-Chenmo, or Chief Steward of the Palace, but in practice, he is the closest political ally and lifelong friend of our beloved King. Born in 1902 as the son of a former Chief Steward, Athingla - as he his traditionally called - received formal education at both Colonial Anglo and Tibetan schools before rising to his first government position, and from there he befriended Tashi and climbed the ranks of the Sikkimese hierarchy until he was the chief confidant and advisor to the 11th Chogyal. Standing by his king through his push for reforms and the rise of radicalism and the influence of the Kazis, the Grand Man of Sikkim Athingla aids Tashi loyally and devoutly in this mountainous paradise, safeguarding traditional Sikkimese society and religion against corrosive forces while aiding his friend and liege."

sikkim.22.t:0 "The Fate of the People’s Chogyal"
sikkim.22.d:0 "With Jerman waging war against the nobility, many have begun to wonder and question what they should do with the former Chogyal. Since their revolution, Tashi has been confined to house arrest within his palace as Jerman slowly contemplated on what to do with the former monarch. Hardliners and radicals in the party demand his death - to be killed in the same fashion as the Kazis once tried to kill Jerman, by tying him to a table and letting a caged and starving tiger do the rest - but others say elsewise. Many believe that his reformist ambitions, though compromised and failed, earn him some merit, and these groups have come up with two alternate solutions - either send him into exile where he will likely go stay with the entourage of the Dalai Lama, or force him to become a monk in the hallowed Rumtek Monastery where he could do no harm."
sikkim.22.a:0 "There is only one acceptable fate. Send him to the tiger pit!"

Leaving with an extravagant entourage to Lhasa, Tashi and the various countries and lamas accompanying him were abuzz, but this all mellowed soon after they arrived.\n\nFinally arriving at their destination at Potala Palace, Tashi met with his reborn friend, who was now just a young baby from the northern villages. Awkwardly ‘admitting’ he recognized the boy as his old and dear friend, Tashi and the baby Dalai Lama spent some time together as Tashi reminisced old stories about him and the boy’s past life. With their bond reconnected across time and space, Tashi has exclaimed he shall be like an uncle to his old friend, and plans to make frequent visits to Lhasa to help raise and guide the spiritual leader’s new form."

sikkim.24.t:0 "A Brush With Death"
sikkim.24.d:0 "Sitting at the counter within the local inn inside his personal dzong fortress, Jerman relaxed with many of his fellow revolutionaries as they recounted stories of mystery and awe. However, never to be beaten, Jerman had just the story to light a spark in his followers. Casting back to his time spent in prison after being arrested by the Kazis for peacefully obstructing a noble’s palanquin forcibly lifted on the backs of serfs, Jerman described the time he killed a tiger with his own two hands. \n\nTied to a table by his captors and left in a room with a starved and deranged apex predator, Jerman was able to break free from his bonds before the beast could get a hold of him before strangling the beast to death using all his remaining strength. With the beast slain, Jerman made his escape before the guards had noticed the tiger did not make its easy kill, and retreated into the mountains where he survived for days on his own before being picked up by loyal revolutionary allies. \n\nAs always, the story excited his men, sparking to life their morale and their dedication to their reformationist cause. They knew that all they had to do was follow Jerman the Tiger Slayer and Sikkim would reach prosperity."

sikkim.25.d:0 "Jerman Lepcha is a well-known reformer and proponent of peaceful resistance, waging a non-violent war of protest against the Kazis and other corrupt and oppressive nobles. Organizing sit-ins, boycotts, prayer vigils, group fastings, marches, and more to resist the aristocratic parasites, Jerman is the voice and face of a free republican future for Sikkim. However, his detractors and opponents do not share his dedication to nonviolence, and much blood has been spilled on the side of Jerman and his allies. Despite it all, Jerman persists, holding faith that Chogyal Tashi will see his dedication and follow through on his promise of sweeping reform, for if he did not, all hope for a peaceful resolution would be lost in the eyes of Jerman."

Utilizing traditional architectural designs, a series of border walls and fortified monasteries - or Dzongs - shall be created across Sikkim. Though we already have many of these stalwart holy houses all across the nation, such as the mighty hilltop fortress known as Kampa Dzong in northern Sikkim, we will need more in order to defend our people and our homes. With tall, inward sloping walls of stone sealed with great gates of iron while decorated internally with all the brightly colored fineries of traditional Buddhist décor, these marvels of engineering shall form a great bastion - both tied to our military, our faith, and our tradition - to deter any would-be invader seeking to trample the mighty Sikkim beneath their foolish ambitions."

sikkim.27.d:0 "Overjoyed by the news of a Socialist-inspired revolution within our borders, the traveling mystic and Buddhist-Socialist artist and archeologist Nikolas Roerich has come to visit Sikkim. Meeting with Jerman Lepcha in Gangtok, the two devout Buddhists spent ages discussing poetry, art, Socialist theory, and Buddhist theology among other topics while drinking warm yak butter tea and smoking pipe in Jerman’s personal Dzong fortress. Exchanging stories and tales of adventure, the boisterous evening turned into a long night as the two titans of Eastern Theological Socialism conversed and shared ideas. By the time dawn broke once more, the two had still yet to run out of conversation, and their meeting had to be broken up by their aids who recommended to both of them that matters of statecraft must come first over these friendly chats. A solid friendship established, Roerich prepared to return to his adoptive home of Lhasa, promising to return to Jerman’s domain in order to continue their deep discussions on the beyond."

Sikkim lies nestled within one of the safest and most isolated regions on Earth, and if we so desire, we could seal ourselves away in this mountain hold as we work to build our metamorphosed state alone and in peace. However, to do so would be to deny our supposed destiny of uniting the Himalayas and its diverse people - a foolish but common dream for many in our clique. With our past settled and the future wide open, what shall be the destiny of our Sikkim on the world stage?"

Most oppressive and dominant of all these groups are the Kazi Landlords, who dominate the serf-based agricultural system of Sikkim as well as much of our construction and civic development industries. Long standing as the bastion to conservative and elitist Sikkimese society, the Kazi were disturbed over our revolution, and now have moved to strike. Gathering support from a large section of the military as well as from most of the anti-reformist elite that fear Jerman’s new direction, the Kazi Landlords now seek to topple the current reformist government to stop our government from limiting their power and seizing their wealth. With this wave of support behind them, they have moved to revolt against the revolutionary government, and fighting has broken out across Sikkim. What few loyalists we have in the military are already stretched thin, and we only have enough reinforcements from the militias to aid one of our key regions. Where should we send the militias?"

As a result, when the main Kazi assault pushed on Gangtok and the Tsuklakhang palace where we were holding the rest of the royal family, our meager and tired forces were completely crushed. Now, our revolution falls to the conservative and elitist Kazi as Jerman Lepcha flees into hiding."

Our clique is split between the idea of reinstating the monarchy or not, and three options now lie before us. If we were to allow the Namgyal Dynasty back on the throne, they would be entirely subject to our whim and puppets of our desires. The most obvious candidate would be to crown the Crown Prince Palijor Namgyal, a veteran and ace pilot who is studying abroad with the British in Delhi. Though definitely fit to rule, he may be hard to control and is beloved by the masses, making him a potential threat. Instead, we could crown the young Palden Namgyal, who is merely a child and as such would be far easier to control and mold to our will. Finally, we could abandon the monarchy altogether, establishing a conservative and aristocratic republic under Kazi rule. What should we do?"

Flattered by the invitation and enticed by the free ticket to a life of ease and luxury, Lombard accepted Palden’s proposition and has flown out to Gangtok in order to become the Gyalmo, or Queen Consort, of Sikkim. In a lavish Buddhist ceremony, the two were wed, and Chogyal has never seemed happier. Let us hope they have a long and happy marriage!"

In the running are the dominant Sikkimese National Party, who are nationalists who support Sikkimese independence, conservatism, nationalism, and autarky, but are plagued by a radical wing of theocratic and hyper-nationalist Buddhists. Their main rivals are the Sikkim State Congress - a large coalition of agrarian liberals and capitalist conservatives predominantly made up of the large Nepalese and Indian minorities. Trailing behind both of these main parties are the remnants of Jerman Lepcha’s failed SKM, which has moderated their stances dramatically but still push for a radically progressive and egalitarian Sikkim democracy, and are committed to work within the democratic system to achieve it. However, only one party can win, and with the final votes being counted, who shall win these historic elections?"

sikkim.37.d:0 "As we further stabilize our new regime, the internal leadership debate that has long brewed within our ranks must finally be put to rest. The two main factions vying for power are the deeply conservative and anti-democratic Old Guard, made up of old elites and aristocrats that seek to build a republic without democracy here in Sikkim, perhaps even with a puppeted Chogyal on the throne. Resisting these elitists are the small but dedicated wind of reformers within the Kazi clique led by Kazi Lhendup Dorjee. These reformers have greatly distanced themselves from any of the rhetoric or actions of Jerman Lepcha, but still advocate for a more equal Sikkimese society supported by free democracy. Only one group can lead Sikkim and the landlords however, so who shall rise to lead us into our new destiny?"

Locked in a familiar dungeon he had been in before, Jerman was arrested by the Kazi after being caught by their loyal gurkhas in the lowlands on the way to Calcutta, being caught disguised as a petty and elderly serf trying to seek asylum with the Southern Socialists. Instead, he will now meet the fate that should have befallen him years ago, and this time he will not be able to fight his way out. As the cage doors opened before him, the last thing Jerman Lepcha saw was the orange and black blur of two massive Bengal tigers diving at his full speed. In moments filled with agonizing screams, blood-curdling cries, and the sounds of roaring and tearing flesh, all that was left of the failed revolutionary was a pile of bones, blood, and refuse tissue and organs too distasteful for the beasts to consume. It would seem that the man that could kill one tiger with his bare hands could not kill two."

Schmiedl traveled to Delhi where he launched his own rocket at Sikkim while waiting for the rocket sent by Taylor-Smith to reach him from Gangtok, with each holding a simple message in a secure mail tube. Miraculously, both rockets made it to their destinations, though each was several hundred meters off-target due to the extreme range the experimental technology was pushed to. Regardless, the experiment was a success, bringing more prestige to the project and in turn, to the state."

This paradise within the Himalayas, also called Drenjong by the Tibetans meaning the Hidden Valley of Rice, is one of the most isolated, pristine, and beatious places on Earth. For centuries, the Namgyal Dynasty has ruled over these lands, and for centuries, we have persisted despite the many obstacles thrown at us. However, with tensions brewing, radicalism spreading, and with the world seemingly on the brink of war yet again, all is not well in this mountainous paradise. We must remain vigilant as Chogyal Tashi Namgyal attempts to guide us through to prosperity."

skm_the_lamas_desc:0 "Sikkim is a land of faith and spirituality, with a ruling class along with a sizeable portion of the population being Buddhist, living in relative peace with a large Hindu population along with other smaller faithful minorities such as the Sikhs and the Jainists. However, no clerical group within Sikkim is more influential than the Buddhist Lamas, for even our beloved Chogyals are crowned by each incarnation of the Dalai Lama. Though dominant, their role in the government is often a large and messy grey area, and as such, we should move to formalize the role these holymen have in our Kingdom."

Sikkim is the Chogyal, and the Chogyal is Sikkim."

We must remain on their good sides if Tashi is to achieve anything during his reign, but that is easier said than done when his reforms fly directly in their faces.

However, with the rising popularity of the radically liberal Sikkim Kratiakari Morcha slowly growing more and more tired of the exploitation wrought at the hands of the aristocracy underneath but unshackled by the king, the continuation of this centuries-old monarchy is far from assured."

Tashi has worked tirelessly with the nobility in order to reach some forms of agreeable compromise, and has begun to transition some of Sikkim’s land into the hands of the masses. Small landowners have begun to rise up from the most hardworking, the most savvy, and the more influential of the lower classes. Though it is a far cry from a total break from feudalism, it is a massive step in a modern direction for such a tiny nation, and this change will be monitored closely as the masses of Sikkim step from 1666 into 1936."

All parties are allowed to run in the elections, and whoever wins shall rise to aid Tashi as his loyal, but subservient, advisors and allies.

Aristocratic families and groups like the Namgyal Dynasty or the Kazis have oppressed the people and hoarded the wealth of Sikkim for far too long. Their lands will be nationalized and prepared for redistribution while their assets are liquidated and dispersed to government funds and programs as well as the masses, and they themselves will largely face exile, prison, or death, with only special exemptions being made for non-corrupt nobles that are members of the various clergies and other nobles that championed the cause of the people before Jerman’s rise.

skm_tourism_desc:0 "We should let the world know of our mountain paradise, for it is the very name of our proud and beauteous nation. Encouraging tourism could generate capital for the state. From the famous temple-city at Namchi to the beautiful Rumtek Monastery. From the gorgeous and crystal-clear Teesta River to the verdant fields of tea and cardamom that cover the Southern agri-fields. From the peaks of the mighty Himalayas capped with ice and snow such as our own Jongsong Peak and Kangchengjunga to the heart of our own lush forests of orchids, rhododendrons, bamboo, pines, sal trees, and so much more unique flora and fauna - our Sikkim truly is paradise on Earth. Now, we must prove this fact to the world and capitalize on it in order to drive the state towards prosperity."

skm_hand_crafted:0 "Capitalize on Traditional Handicrafts"
skm_hand_crafted_desc:0 "Long has Sikkimese economics revolved around the creation, trade, and sale of traditional handicrafts made by our talented citizens. With culturally rich and varied art forms such as carpet and blanket weaving, Thangka painting, wood and mask carving, bamboo crafts, and jewelry-making to far more intricate pursuits such as Sikkim Pass Copies - locally hand-made weapons built from scrap and discarded weaponry based on captured European designs - and our famous watchmaking industry, the local industries of Sikkim are decentralized but foundational to our society. We must aid our artisans and citizens in the production and sale of these diverse products both domestically and internationally in order to bring financial growth to the people and to our national markets."

skm_rocket_mail:0 "Rocketmail Soars Over Sikkim"
skm_rocket_mail_desc:0 "Anglo-Indian aerospace engineer and rocket scientist Stephen Hector Taylor-Smith has proposed a unique style of sending mail by rocket to accommodate our mountainous terrain. First choosing to hold his experiments here due to our rugged landscape and original funded by the Namgyal Dynasty, Dr. Taylor-Smith has had many recent breakthroughs in this technology. We shall incorporate his unique technology into our logistics systems while also using his developments in rocketry to benefit our armed forces. Now, let us blast off towards modernity!"

skm_tanning_hides:0 "Modernize the Tanneries"
skm_tanning_hides_desc:0 "The Sikkimese leather-working industry has been a part of our national economy and culture for centuries, with local fauna such as Sikkimese veau, serow, goral, goa and more providing their hides in order to produce some of the softest leather in the known world. We will support our local tanneries through increased funding to support our economy, while also moving to modernize and industrialize the largest ones in Gangtok in order to meet international demands. Fine leather goods shall forever be an integral part of our export-based economy, and these reforms shall ensure it while also ensuring this industry turns a profit as well."

skm_distillery:0 "Let the Guras Ko Raksi Flow"
skm_distillery_desc:0 "Sikkim has a long history of brewing and distilling alcohol from local produce. From standard grain-based beers called Chaang, sometimes flavored with scrambled eggs or fenugreek seeds, to the sweet, mild Jaad beers made from fermented millet, local brews are diverse. Most famous is the coveted Guras Ko Raksi - a traditional spring wine made from the Guras, or rhododendron flower, mashed with yeast and rice or millet - and together with other brews, these alcoholic concoctions have evolved into one of our biggest and most world-renowned industries. We must fund established breweries while also creating state-owned distilleries in order to make these amber delicacies for the masses and profit from their international sale."

skm_tea_time:0 "Sow the Temi Tea Plantation"
skm_tea_time_desc:0 "Consolidating land once farmed by numerous smaller estates and farmholds, the Temi Tea Garden shall rise as one of the largest tea gardens in East Asia, accompanied by cardamom plantations and tree orchards. Established in the city of Temi in South Sikkim, here we shall primarily grow what is now called Temi Tea - some of the finest tea and most prized in all the world - enmasse utilizing organic manuring methods mixed with modernized practices in order to meet the demands of our people and international markets. Soon, this verdant patch of paradise shall bring great prosperity and fame to our beloved valley."

skm_cultivating_crops:0 "Diversify Our Crops"
skm_cultivating_crops_desc:0 "No matter how far we progress into modernity, Sikkim will always be a primarily agricultural nation. However, many of our crops currently grown do not do much to aid the wider economy, and mainly work to either feed the masses or enrich the nobility. We must use our fertile and arable land to cultivate a wider variety of crops and in far greater amounts, such as maize, millet, wheat, barley, oranges, rhododendrons, and cardamom, along with financially-sound cash crops like bamboo in order to bring economic prosperity to the state.."

skm_mining:0 "Dig into the Bhotang Mines"
skm_mining_desc:0 "The deepmines at Bhotang supply our nation with zinc, copper, and lead, as well as more exotic metals and polymetallic minerals. It would be foolish to not support our miners, so we shall dig even deeper at this valuable location. Furthermore, we shall send out land survey teams in order to find new mineral deposits and ore veins or seams, allowing us to build new mines into the Himalayas in the future."

skm_himalayan_bridge:0 "Blast Through Nathu La Pass"
skm_himalayan_bridge_desc:0 "Our unique location connects us between India to the South and China and Tibet to the North, with Sikkim standing as the bridge between these two distinct worlds. We can funnel this important trade through Gangtok and fuel our economy if we could clear up key mountain-passes such as Jelep La and Nathu La to facilitate easier travel through the mountains. To aid in this endeavor, the Namgyal National Highway shall also be expanded to connect most of the nation, new mountain tunnels such as the mighty Theng Tunnel shall be carved through the mountains, and the current bus routes, sky-trams, and other forms of public transportation shall also be further funded in order to truly build up our paradise as the Crossroads of the Himalayas."

skm_a_sikkimese_economy:0 "The Sikkimese Industrial Reformation"
skm_a_sikkimese_economy_desc:0 "Not quite a full ‘Industrial Revolution’, we have still taken great steps towards modernizing Sikkim’s economy. As we drag ourselves out from our feudalistic past, we shall never lose sight of what truly makes Sikkim Sikkim. We have created a unique economy that combines both traditional and modern methods that is perfectly form-fit for our realities. Now, let us embrace this new direction and these new developments as we blast off towards our new and prosperous future."

skm_reform_the_army:0 "Reform Our Archaic Armed Forces"
skm_reform_the_army_desc:0 "Our army is in the same condition as it was almost four centuries ago, and we can no longer ignore this reality. The wolves circle Sikkim now more than ever as Nepal, India, and the Chinese all plot to conquer our mountain paradise. If we are to survive the coming century and the maelstrom it brings, we must bring our army up to standard and out of the past."

skm_use_the_terrain:0 "Master of the Mountains"
skm_use_the_terrain_desc:0 "We will train our armies to make use of the mountainous and forested terrain of our rugged and isolated home. By recruiting local sherpa guides and undergoing extensive mountain training formed around the newly-created Sikkimese Scouts and our loyal Gurkha allies, we will make use of our terrain like never before in a new generation of organized guerilla warfare."

skm_air_warfare:0 "Take Flight Over Paradise"
skm_air_warfare_desc:0 "We have heard of new, unique forms of controlling the air. By importing auto-gyros and outdated planes from the Indians and Anglos as well as new experimental helicopters from the Germans, or other less obvious sources, we will come to rule the skies over this mountain paradise. As these new air wings and experimental technologies are incorporated into our armed forces, they will be trained to work in concert with our ground forces, ensuring maximum combat potential."

skm_modern_army:0 "Towards a Modern Military"
skm_modern_army_desc:0 "We have brought our once antiquated army up to modern standards, or at least to the standards of armies during the Great War. Though we are outgunned and outnumbered, we have done our best to turn this verdant valley into a veritable fortress. Our enemies will regret ever picking a fight with our mountain paradise."

skm_modernize_equipment:0 "Import Contemporary Military Hardware"
skm_modernize_equipment_desc:0 "It is an embarrassment that our army still uses bows and spears in large quantities. We will import new military equipment from China, India, and Europe in order to at least bring us up to standard with armies of the last few decades, and supplement our arsenal with easily-gathered armaments like the avalanche guns used by our mountain service. Though we will still have to use some archaic equipment as back-ups, we shall aim for a rifle for every man."

skm_recruitment_drive:0 "Tap the Villages for Manpower"
skm_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "The Sikkim Guard needs manpower, direly. However, that is no small feat in a nation as sparsely populated and disconnected as ours. We must do our best to rally able-bodied men from each and every village in Sikkim, for all must do their part to defend our home."

skm_himalayan_arms_race:0 "The Himalayan Arms Race"
skm_himalayan_arms_race_desc:0 "Our military and accompanying industries are languishing in archaic ineptitude, causing our armed forces to stagnate as our neighbors across the Himalayas only grow stronger and more ready for war. We must do what we can as we work to secure and safeguard Sikkim for any and all threats, and to begin, we must begin some form of widespread militarization."
