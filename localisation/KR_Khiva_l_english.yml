### Events ###
khiva.1.t:0 "The Khanate of Khiva"
khiva.1.d:0 "The Khanate of Khiva has been a Russian protectorate since 1873. However, after the 1917 February Revolution in Russia, the myriad of liberal reforms that were planned were not performed, chiefly due to the conservative views of the Khivan Khan Isfandiyar. Later, the Khan was assassinated and the seat of power was eventually seized by the leader of the Turkmen tribes, Junaid Khan. He placed Sayid Abdullah, younger brother of Isfandiyar, as a puppet monarch. Junaid Khan himself became a Vizier, but he's been the de-facto head of Khivan state for all these 18 years since his coup. His aggressive foreign policy led to terrible defeats against the Reds, but the forces of marxists were not enough to defeat the Khan’s Host. The Reds were defeated in Russia and Junaid Khan consolidated his rule as the dictator of Khiva. For 15 years he legislated numerous conservative and autocratic policies that helped Khiva to remain an agrarian, nomadic country in the middle of the desert. The opposition to the regime of Junaid Khan has been growing in the years since his rule began and it is becoming very dangerous for the 79-year old dictator, who can barely control the country as in, to perform his duties or even feel safe."
khiva.1.a:0 "Khiva Lives On!"

khiva.2.t:0 "Junaid Khan Is Dead!"
khiva.2.d:0 "The Vizier of Khiva, Junaid Khan has died of a stroke at the age of 79. Sayid Abdullah, Khan of Khiva, has now to decide who should make the new head of government. While Khan himself is a poor leader, as he has been a ceremonial figure for almost 20 years, he believes he is strong enough to install an absolute monarchy in the region, asking the Emir of Bukhara for support. On the other hand, Khiva is in strong need of modernization, and perhaps making the leader of the Young Khiva Party the new Vizier will benefit the Khanate. The third option is to make Eshi-Khan, an honorable Khivan general and the main representative of the Mujahideen movement in Khiva, the new grand Vizier to guide the inexperienced Khan."
khiva.2.a:0 "Bobo Ahun, Young Khiva leader."
khiva.2.b:0 "Eshi-Khan, the leader of Mujahideen."
khiva.2.c:0 "The Khan consolidates his rule as absolute monarch."

khiva.3.t:0 "Bobo Ahun Demands Khan's Abdication"
khiva.3.d:0 "The new Vizier, Bobo Ahun, demands that Sayid Abdullah should not only divest himself of authority as an absolute monarch, but also abdicate from his throne. While the Khan was shocked to hear about the Vizier's wild proposal, he agrees, at least somewhat, that the Khanate needs modernization to survive. The question on the Khan’s mind now is whether the Khanate needs the radical and rapid modernization of Bobo Ahun, or should our archaic state be modernized gradually by the Khan himself?"
khiva.3.a:0 "He is reasonable. The Khan should abdicate."
khiva.3.b:0 "This is nonsense. The Khan will stay as an absolute monarch and reform gradually."

khiva.4.t:0 "Young Khiva Revolution"
khiva.4.d:0 "Outraged by the Khan's words and his unwillingness to allow for Khiva’s rapid modernization and reform, the Young Khiva Party has organized mass protests in the city of Khiva and its outlying nomad towns. The Khan has mobilized the Mujahideen to disperse the crowd, but the power of revolutionaries is only growing."
khiva.4.a:0 "Send the Mujahideen to crush these reformers"

khiva.5.t:0 "Armed Conflict in Khiva"
khiva.5.d:0 "There are numerous reports coming in from the south about armed conflicts between Young Khiva protesters and the Mujahideen militants led by Eshi-Khan. The streets of the ancient city are being bathed in blood as the opposing forces clash for the soul of Khiva. Despite the victor, it seems that the bloodshed cannot be avoided and will rage on until one side finally falters."
khiva.5.a:0 "Attempt to agree to the Young Khiva's demands."
khiva.5.b:0 "Mobilize more forces in Khiva to crush them."

khiva.6.t:0 "Young Khiva Victory"
khiva.6.d:0 "The Mujahideen were completely destroyed in Khiva with Young Khivans raising the flag of a liberated Khiva high over the city. Their braveness has encouraged other citizens in Khivan cities across the nation to rise up as well in protest and revolt and today the personal forces and royal guard of Khan Sayid Abdullah himself were crushed as well, signalling the end of his horrid reign. The Khan has been forced to abdicate and has fled into exile while the Young Khiva Party has declared the Republic of Khiva in Khiva where the first battle was won."
khiva.6.a:0 "Long Live the Khivan Republic!"

khiva.7.t:0 "Khan's Victory"
khiva.7.d:0 "The Young Khiva protesters were completely and utterly annihilated in Khiva with Mujahideen forces ending the fighting with burning of the Young Khivan’s republican flags. Sayid Abdullah, Khan of Khiva, has arrived to personally congratulate the Mujahideen on their victory. Now nothing can stop Khiva from respecting the traditions of Kadimism."
khiva.7.a:0 "Long Live the Khanate!"

khiva.8.t:0 "Eshi-Khan's Suggestion"
khiva.8.d:0 "The leader of the Khivan Mujahideen, Eshi-Khan, has approached Sayid-Abdullah with a suggestion to follow the ideology of Islamic Federation in order to introduce more strict Islamic laws in the country and federalize the Khanate. Moreover, we should change our foreign affiliation, aligning with other Mujahideen in Turkestan in order to create a unified and federalized Islamic state in Central Asia."
khiva.8.a:0 "His ideas are reasonable."
khiva.8.b:0 "The Khan shall rule alone and listen to no advice."

khiva.9.t:0 "Young Khiva Victory"
khiva.9.d:0 "Young Khiva Party, led by Bobo Ahun stayed victorious in the first republican elections in Khivan history. While Khiva is finally opened to modernization, we will probably lose an ally in the Emirate of Bukhara, as our modern ideals of Jadidism do not align with their traditional views. The Young Khiva movement, with their newfound strength and influence, can also probably provoke the Young Bukhara Party to rebel against or cooperate with their recent win as well, drawing them out into the open and cutting the head off the snake before their influence grows too strong."
khiva.9.a:0 "Perhaps we should ally Young Bukhara before they rebel as well."
khiva.9.b:0 "Strengthen the power of Mujahideen in the region."
khiva.9.c:0 "Congratulate the new Khivan Government."

khiva.10.t:0 "Mujahideen Victory in Khiva"
khiva.10.d:0 "The Young Khiva Party, led by Bobo Ahun, was crushed in the recent elections in the regal Khanate of Khiva. The power in the Khanate’s government under the Khan has been transferred to the Mujahideen, meaning we can still rely on both the royal houses and the Emirate of Bukhara to aid us in case of war with the foul liberal of Kokand. The Young Khivan’s loss can also probably provoke the Young Khivan Party to rebell as well, finally pushing them too far to open up a position to discredit them for good."
khiva.10.a:0 "Congratulate Mujahideen in Khiva on their recent win."
khiva.10.b:0 "Congratulate the Mujahideen and push the Young Khivans."

With the gun-runners exposed, our government has put them on trial, also launching a large-scale investigation into leaks in weapons depots, and has also expressed a diplomatic protest to Khiva, restricting all trade with them."
khiva.15.a:0 "No smuggling in Russia will be tolerated."

khiva.16.t:0 "Russian Government Outraged"
khiva.16.d:0 "The Russian government managed to expose our contact, confiscating tons of weaponry, ready to sail to us. They quickly found out who the customer was, and now their government has seized all the contacts with us, also enacting embargo."

khiva.21.d:0 "The 1936 has just began only to inform the closest confederates of Junaid-Khan about his illness. The 79-year old Yomud, Dictator of Khwarezm, who has been in power for 18 years, has not only become too paranoid and physically ill, but, perhaps... mentally ill, as well.\n\nThe Jadidist movement of Young Khivans, who has for long been a cause for all Khan's crackdowns on freedom, has gained some strength over the years, especially after the neighboring Kokand Republic gained some stability and strength.\n\nMoreover, some of the Turkmen tribes in the south became too unruly, blocking the trade ways from Persia and Afghanistan, raiding on the caravans and preventing gold, goods and weapons from reaching the Junaid-Khan's treasury. It's time to deal with all these problems, while the dictator is still alive."
khiva.21.a:0 "The rule of Junaid-Khan is under threat."

khiva.22.t:0 "Pacifying the Southern Tribes"
khiva.22.d:0 "The Southern Turkmen tribes have been rebelling against our rule since 1935, when Junaid-Khan has demanded more tribute from them, due to the economic isolation of the Khanate. When they refused, he ordered to incinerate fertile fields and burn villages to the ground. This criminal order was successfully carried out by his henchmen, depriving the khanate of some of the harvest, and some Turkmen tribes of families, shelter and food.\n\nThe Turkmen tribes should be pacified now, and the old Dictator suggested that he should visit their elders himself and make them respect him. While some of his henchmen believe this to be generally a bad idea, no one dares to dissuade Junaid Khan, fearing for his head."
khiva.22.a:0 "The Dictator shall visit Ashgabat himself."

With Mujahideen on our side, our victory seems inevitable, but we should not understimate our opponents and ask for some support from who we can."
