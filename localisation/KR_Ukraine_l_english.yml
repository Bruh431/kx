###Bio###
POLITICS_PAVLO_SKOROPADSKYI_DESC:0 "Pavlo Skoropadskyi, opportunist, Cossack, military officer, descendant of Ukrainian nobility, but above all - he is Hetman, leader of Ukraine, whose power depends only on Soim and the King.\n\nTracing his lineage back to the hetman of the 18th century Zaporozhian Army, Skoropadskyi rose through the ranks of the tsar's military in a flash. During the Ukrainian Revolution, Pavlo Skoropadskyi became the chief organizer of the specially created Ukrainian Army Corps and numerous Cossack volunteer detachments that sought to fight the pro-Bolshevik militias. An ardent opponent of socialism, Skoropadskyi, along with his capitalist, landowner and military allies, began a conspiracy against the Ukrainian People's Republic before overthrowing it on April 29, 1918. This could not have been accomplished without the Kaiser's help, and to repay him, Skoropadskyi soon found himself in deep military and economic ties with Germany.\n\nOnly King Vasyl, who in the eyes of the hetman is seen only as a compromise imposed by the Austrians, resists. Anything deemed contrary to the national interest is strictly forbidden and brutally persecuted. With the weakness and powerlessness of Soim, there is only a faint illusion of democracy in Ukraine, but hatred for the Hetman's autocracy grows among the court and a conspiracy matures..."
POLITICS_VASYL_DESC:0 "Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen is known to many as King Vasyl Vyshyvani. By many he is regarded as a symbol of foreign dominance, imposed on Ukraine as a result of a compromise between Germany and Austria. However, the others know, that Vasyl is fascinated by Ukrainian culture, he writes and speaks Ukrainian, and there is not a single argument, except for his origin, that he is not worthy of the throne of Ukraine. Even before he became Vasyl Vyshyvani, he received the nickname \"The Red Prince\" for his desire to improve the living conditions of the poor Ukrainian population of Galicia. In fact, among the few legal parties of Ukraine sitting in the Soim, it is Vasyl who is being put faith on. However, with a stagnant economy, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, and most of all, tension with the influential Hetman and his SHD, Vasyl struggles to maintain authority."
POLITICS_NIKITA_KRUSCHEV_DESC:0 "Nikita Kruschev, authoritarian socialist, has become the premier of Ukraine. Kruschev, born to Russian peasants near the current Russian-Ukrainian border, harbours a deep disdain for the landowning Kulaks; he plans to eliminate the Kulaks as a social class through forced seizure and collectivisation of their land. Such measures, however, are unpopular among all but a small number of Ukrainians, which may force Kruschev to compromise."
POLITICS_LEO_STEFAN_DESC:0 "King Leo Stefan von Habsburg-Lothringen, while ethnically Austrian, has been raised in the Ukrainian culture. While to some, Leo's ascension is indicative of compromise between the Reichspakt and Ukraine, many lament the continued dominance of Ukraine by foreigners. The real compromise, these dissidents claim, was between Germany and Austria, who are now united in support for Leo. Domestically much of Leo's support comes from the powerful land-owning class who now control the Soim and who see the young king as little more than a puppet to illicit Austro-German support for their endeavours."
POLITICS_LEV_II_DESC:0 "Count Leo Stefan was born to the Habsburg-Lorraine family on June 12, 1928. Being groomed to potentially succeed to the throne of a Eastern European state, Leo ended up gaining a lot of knowledge and respect for Ukrainian customs. Eventually he would be raised to this position as Lev II once King Vasyl was killed by a communist, he now tries his best to represent Ukraine. This knowledge and actual attempt to help Ukraine was noticed by some socialists who wished to keep the stability of the crown yet bring forth leftist ideals. Being entangled within these ideals, Lev the II now reigns Ukraine as the People’s King, representing and supporting their struggles against those that would keep the peasantry, and wider Ukraine down."
POLITICS_DANIIL_I_DESC:0 "King Daniil Skoropadskyi, son of the famous 'Hetman', has ascended to the Ukrainian throne. With the long power-struggle between the Hetman and the monarchy finally resolved, Ukraine breathes a sign of relief. Daniil however is quite rightly seen by many as little more than a puppet king, effectively allowing his father to the bulk of rulership while he himself acts as the front-man. Perhaps after Pavlo Skoropadskyi's death will the young king finally be able to assert himself but for now the young king will do just as he is told."

POLITICS_MIKHAIL_BULGAKOV_DESC:0 "Mykhailo Bulhakov, an ethnic Russian born in the Kiev governate, was for much of his life known more so for his prolific writings and literary talents rather than politics. After finding himself heading up the russophile ViN organisation, he is now in charge of the government and has made his intentions clear that the so-called 'Free State of Ukraine' is little more than a temporary fixture until the nation can be annexed into the motherland once more."
POLITICS_DMITRI_DONTSOV_DESC:0 "Dmytro Dontsov has been are the forefront of Ukrainian nationalism for many years and has solidified his position as the primary nationalist ideologue in Ukraine. Having allied with Konovalets and his UVO, Dontsov has become powerful during the interwar and now finally ascended to a position of leadership with his intentions of driving out both German and Russian influences as well as a general crackdown against socialist activity."
POLITICS_YEVHEN_KONOVALETS_DESC:0 "Yevhen Konovalets is the recognizable leader of the Ukrainian nationalist movement and its prime military-political organization, the UVO. His biography is the history of Ukrainian Independence, its struggle for national identity and sovereignity.\n\nBorn in the village near Lemberg, Austria-Hungary, Konovalets was always connected to the Ukrainian national movement. In the pre-Weltkrieg years he became an active member of the Prosvita becoming the secretary of the Lemberg Department, the Ukrainian educational association, In 1913 he met Dmytro Dontsov and became greatly influenced by the nationalist ideology and rhetoric. \n\nConscripted to the Austro-Hungarian Army during the war, he became prisoner-of-war in Russia, where he joined a group of former Galician officers together with Andrii Melnyk, eventually fleeing to Kyiv together. Serving for the independent Ukrainian Republic, he organized the division of Sich Streltsy and later assumed its command, effectively suppressing the Bolshevik uprising in Kyiv and resisting the Communist offensive.\n\nHe soon became the Colonel of Army and the Sich Streltsy regiment of Konovalets were considered one of the most combat-ready units of the Ukrainian army.\n\nEverything changed when the Hetmanate has risen. The regiment was disarmed and disbanded at the request of German command only to Konovalets receiving permission from Hetman Skoropadskyi to form a separate detachment of Sich Streltsy as part of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian state in Bila Tserkva a few months later. The command of the created unit was opposed to the Hetman, but remained faithful to the oath given to the Hetman.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Konovalets, together with Andrii Melnyk and Dmytro Dontsov formed the UVO - a nationalistic organisation, which proclaimed its goal to create a conciliar independent Ukrainian state on ethnic Ukrainian lands with a supreme leader, Konovalets, as its head."
POLITICS_VYACHESLAV_LYPYNSKY_DESC:0 "Vyacheslav Lypynskyi is known to be the main ideologue of the new Ukrainian statehood, the Hetman Movement, the Ukrainian Conservatism, or as he called it himself, the 'theory of Ukrainian Hetman Nationalism'. Despite this, he is a staunch critic of the Hetmanate, as he confronts Skoropadskyi’s desire to become the absolute monarch of Ukraine, as well as he sharply criticizes the radical 'integral nationalism' of Dontsov.\n\nBeing leader of the USKhD, a party once created to support the Hetman, Lypynskyi is soon to find himself among the other oppositional parties and main enemies of the Hetmanate regime."
POLITICS_ANDRIY_MELNYK_DESC:0 "Andriy Melnyk, colonel of the Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic, one of the closest associates of Yevhen Konovalets, as well as one of the organizers of the Ukrainian Military Organization. Since the late 1920s, by order of Konovalets, he was in Galicia, where he represented the UVO, engaged in propaganda of Ukrainian nationalism and distributed anti-Austrian and anti-Polish leaflets.\n\nA staunch nationalist, proponent of the Ukrainian Natiocracy, Melnyk is seen as less radical than Dontsov and Konovalets, focusing more on militarism and centralisation, than on fierce radical nationalism."
POLITICS_DMYTRO_DOROSHENKO_DESC:0 "For Hetman - Doroshenko is a loyal subject, for nationalists - a liberal, and for the Central Committee of the UPR in exile - he is a traitor. \n\nOnce a member of the UPSF, shortly after Hetman Skoropadskyi came to power, Doroshenko became one of the leaders of the Hetman movement, Minister of Foreign Affairs and the main representative of the interests of the national democratic forces. Having created the USKhD together with Lypynskyi, Doroshenko was expelled from the party by the end of the 1920s. This was due to the ideological split between Lypynskyi and the Hetman. Doroshenko created the UDP and remained one of the few supporters of Skoropadskyi, although he held more democratic views. Perhaps one day, he will be able to implement them without conflicting with the interests of the Hetman."
POLITICS_DMYTRO_LEVYTSKY_DESC:0 "Dmytro Levytskyi was born in the Lemberg region of Austria-Hungary, in 1877. He completed law school at the University of Vienna and during Weltkrieg served as an officer in the army of Austria-Hungary. Captured by the Russians in 1915, he spent the remainder of the war in Tashkent. Returning to Ukraine as the Russian Empire fell apart, Levytskyi hoped that the Austria-Hungary will fell, finally allowing for the West Ukrainians to unite with the rest of the country. Unfortunately, it did not happen. Forced to exile, as many democratic leaders, Levytskyi soon established the UNDO together with Mikhnovskyi, becoming his only ally.\n\nNow, when the UNDO finally stays triumphant in the mainland Ukraine, Levytskyi will do all his best to create a constitutional democratic republic with strong national identity."
POLITICS_MYKOLA_MIKHHNOVSKY_DESC:0 "'Mykola Mikhnovskyi is a Ukrainian elemental force,... which is restrained only by a strong and noble mind. He was a highly educated and experienced lawyer, a subtle psychologist, a successful initiator, an outstanding organizer, a brilliant speaker, a talented publicist, an intelligent and tactful leader, an intuitive military commander, an excellent connoisseur of our past, our history and everyday life, a typical revolutionary, that is, a person capable of decisive action. Brought up in good Ukrainian traditions, raised in a Ukrainian village, Mykola Mikhnovsky was a model of Ukrainian racial culture, a Ukrainian aristocrat in all meanings of this concept.' - is the most flattering description of Mykola Mikhnovsky.\n\nIn fact, the reality is somewhat different. All his life Mikhnovsky defended ideas that were not supported by the majority. He has gained a strong reputation as a complex person with whom it is difficult to communicate. Extreme demands narrowed the circle of his friends: only those who shared his views became close.\n\nAn opponent of the policy of the Central Rada, a supporter of Skoropadskyi's coup, Mikhnovsky, unfortunately, turned out to be on the other side of the barricades against his will.\n\nDespite the negative reviews, the Hetman seriously considered Mikhnovsky as a candidate for the post of Prime Minister of the Ukrainian state. He was impressed by anti-socialist views and his recognition of the right of peasants to private ownership of land. However, Pavlo Skoropadskyi was eventually persuaded not to appoint Mikhnovsky as prime minister, and he offered him the position of his personal adviser. The ambitious Mikhnovskyi, of course, refused this, which foretold his future fate.\n\nMykola Mikhnovsky made a lot of efforts to transform the Hetman's political regime into a truly popular Ukrainian government. He was the author of a series of documents criticizing the composition of the government and its policies, subordinated directly to the Hetman. Mikhnovskyi was part of the delegations that appealed to the German occupation authorities. Not trusting the socialists, Mikhnovskyi did not support the idea of a mass anti-Hetman uprising. In the end, all his attempts led to the fact that he was expelled from Ukraine, where he joined Levytskyi and became one of the co-founders of the UNDO, without losing hope of returning to Kyiv."

A member of USDRP, rather socialist-minded politician became the first military minister of the Ukrainian People's Republic, the creator of the first national armed forces of Ukraine. Unlike his fellow party member Vynnychenko, Petliura believed that only a professional regular army will help to win Ukrainian independence. With his special regiment of Haidamaks, Petliura played a major role in suppressing the 'Arsenal' industrial plant and liquidation of last remnants of Bolshevik uprising.\n\nAfter the Hetman's Coup, Petliura together with other social-democrats began to establish shadow structures of opposition across the country, preparing an armed uprising against Skoropadskyi. But as most socialist leaders were arrested or exiled, the uprising never happened and Petliura was forced to flee to Galicia-Lodomeria.\n\nBeing one of the leaders of the exiled forces, Petliura patiently waits for the right moment for a coup. But should the socialists once again turn against Ukrainians, Petliura can use his connections in the army for his own good."
POLITICS_VOLODYMYR_VYNNYCHENKO_DESC:0 "Volodymyr Vynnychenko is considered by many as a founding father of Ukrainian statehood, together with Mykhailo Hrushevskyi. An author of almost all official declarations and legislation of the Ukrainian People's Republic, he also became the first prime-minister of this formally sovereign short-lived state.\n\nAfter the Hetman's Coup, he was arrested by the new government for trumped-up charges. in the preparation of a coup d'etat. However, the German administration pressured Skoropadskyi to liberate him, frightened by the possibility of political destabilisation. He became the leader of the alliance of Ukrainian socialist parties, planning to organize an armed uprising against Skoropadskyi’s dictatorship with the help of Russian Bolsheviks. However, his plans were doomed to failure, and, miraculously avoiding another arrest, together with other former UPR leaders, Vynnychenko fled to Galicia and headed the UPR government in exile.\n\nAlong with Symon Petliura, he is one of the leaders of the upcoming uprising against the Hetman regime, but will he be able to hold off another attempt to create a socialist republic in Ukraine?"

A former member of the Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries, a revolutionary, he soon became the leader of the radical left-wing of the UPSR, who advocated radical views on social and agrarian matters, similar to those of the Bolsheviks and Russian Left SRs.\n\nAfter the coup, Shumskyi defended the course to unfold the struggle against Hetmanate, rapprochement with Bolsheviks, establishing a Soviet Ukrainian state with active Ukrainisation. However, the Bolsheviks have been defeated both in Russia and Ukraine, and Shumskyi, together with the newly created Ukrainian Communist Party of Borotbists, began his active work to destroy the Hetmanate from inside and liberate the Ukrainian peasants and workers."
POLITICS_MYKOLA_STSIBORSKYI_DESC:0 "Mykola Stsiborskyi is an interesting figure in the Ukrainian political scene. A veteran of the Weltkrieg and Russian Civil War, captain in the cavalry of the UPR army, he has a revolutionary temperament and true patriotic feelings for his Motherland.\n\nStsiborskyi supported Skoropadskyi’s coup and managed to build a brilliant military career. He joined the UVO and later became a staunch critic of democracy and one of the ideologists of Ukrainian nationalism. Together with Melnyk, he started UVO propaganda campaign in Galicia-Lodomeria. However, he soon became disenchanted with the state of affairs both in Hetmanate and Ukrainian regions of Galicia-Lodomeria.\n\nAbroad, he met with Mussolini and Mosley and his ideological shift towards Totalism became evident. He understood, that only with a revolutionary spirit, in a republican national-syndicalist system, adapted to the interests of Ukrainian nationalism, with a combined authoritarian-decentralized management system, the revival of Ukraine is possible."

With new infrastructure and technological advancement, Ukraine's agricultural output, already substantial, has grown to become one of the largest in Europe. Ukrainian produce permeates throughout Europe, and perhaps no meal is eaten that hadn't at least partially originated in Ukraine; Ukraine has now truly become the breadbasket of Europe."
UKR_agricultural_crisis_idea:0 "Agricultural Crisis"
UKR_agricultural_crisis_idea_desc:0 "With the introduction of increased tariffs by Mitteleurope, our country is facing a serious crisis in agriculture. Deliveries of modern equipment from Germany have stopped, and bread has to be delivered at undervalued prices. As a result, we are faced with an overabundance of agricultural products that cannot meet the demand. On the one hand, the agricultural crisis has provoked an increase in unemployment, as some farms have declared bankruptcy, but more seriously, this year's sowing may fail and potentially lead to famine."

Most of the positions in the hetman's army were held by Russian officers, the vast majority not of Ukrainian nationality. However, with little hope for the loyalty of the peasantry, the hetman turned to another source of replenishing his army, namely foreign mercenaries. In contrast to civil war-torn Russia, Ukraine was securely protected by Austro-Hungarian and German bayonets and was a real oasis of tranquility, which attracted a great number of officers of the former Tsarist army who formed officer volunteer detachments with a very skeptical, and sometimes hostile, attitude toward Ukrainian statehood. It was only by the end of the 1920s that Hetman managed to establish conscription, open an officers' academy and achieve minimal Ukrainianization of the armed forces. However, the political strife between the military under Hetman and the Soim, led by the king, left the Ukrainian armed forces in such disarray that they are in a dire need of reform."

### New Events ###
ukrpol.1.t:0 "Our Kingdom"
ukrpol.1.d:0 "The Ukrainian State declared its independence with the support of Germany on April 28, 1918, when, as a result of a coup against the left-leaning Central Rada, the initial experiment with socialism in the form of a People's Republic was canceled. Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, a strong-willed man and a former general of the Russian army, who set the tone for the future of Ukraine, came to power. This state of affairs was soon ratified by the Brest-Litovsk peace agreement.\n\nUkraine was to become a breadbasket used by the military aristocratic elite from all over Eastern Europe as a source of food, a convenient market for goods and a military bulwark against the weakened Russian Republic. Skoropadskyi relied on large landowners, the old bureaucracy and officers and sought to build a new Ukrainian monarchy with himself at the head. The leaders of the People's Republic were expelled from the country, and their parties were banned, but they were able to establish a government in exile in neighboring Galicia-Lodomeria, where a significant part of Ukrainians lived.\n\nHowever, German aid soon turned into payment of informal debts to the allies for the Hetman. For some time, the dispute between Germany and its Austro-Hungarian ally continued after the Weltkrieg, eventually settling on a compromise according to which King Vasyl, the Austrian Archduke Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, would rule with the support of Skoropadskyi, who, as a German-allied \"Hetman\", has incredible powers both in civil and military matters. In fact, the Hetman still remained practically the sole ruler of Ukraine, limited only by the King and the Soim, which is increasingly dissatisfied with Skoropadskyi's policy.\n\nNow, almost twenty years after the Weltkrieg, the situation in the country is unstable. The Reich forces us to sell our goods almost exclusively to countries within its sphere of influence, while syndicalists are gaining popularity every day among the oppressed rural poor and urban workers. Despite these many problems we face, our land is prosperous and fertile, our people are hardworking, and our potential is limitless."
ukrpol.1.a:0 "Shche Ne Vmerla Ukraina!"

ukrpol.2.t:0 "The Hetman"
ukrpol.2.d:0 "The role of the Hetman of Ukraine - the permanent Pavlo Skoropadskyi in domestic and foreign policy is very great. He is the supreme head of the state, the army and the judiciary. State administration was carried out by the Government appointed by him. Pavlo Skoropadskyi was proclaimed the guarantor of order and legality before the elections of the Ukrainian Soim. \n\nHowever, everything changed in 1922. As a result of the compromise of Germany with Austria-Hungary, the political system of the Hetmanate changed. Austrian Archduke Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, was crowned in Kyiv as King Vasyl, elections were held to the new Ukrainian Soim. As a result of all this, the Hetman's power was limited, although he continued to be the supreme leader and commander-in-chief, and none of the decisions were made without his approval. The parties of the Soim that existed under strict control soon became quite oppositional and stopped seeing the Hetman as the only possible ruler of Ukraine. His desire for sole power rejected them and hindered the emerging ideology of Ukrainian monarchism and conservatism, which saw the Hetman as an exclusively symbolic figure.\n\nThe Hetman sees the future of Ukraine only in increasing his own power and turning the country into a real Hetmanate with himself at the head. And there would be practically no obstacles to this if it were not for the Soim and the King."
ukrpol.2.a:0 "Zghynut Nashi Vorohy, Yak Rosa Na Sontsi"

ukrpol.3.t:0 "The King and the Soim"
ukrpol.3.d:0 "Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen is known to many as King Vasyl Vyshyvani. By many he is regarded as a symbol of foreign dominance, imposed on Ukraine as a result of a compromise between Germany and Austria. However, the others know, that Vasyl is fascinated by Ukrainian culture, he writes and speaks Ukrainian, and there is not a single argument, except for his origin, that he is not worthy of the throne of Ukraine. Even before he became Vasyl Vyshyvani, he received the nickname \"The Red Prince\" for his desire to improve the living conditions of the poor Ukrainian population of Galicia.\n\nFor almost 15 years, the Hetman of Ukraine has been doing everything to marginalize the King, and not giving him the opportunity to show his best side. Therefore, the only support and hope of Vasyl is Austria and the Ukrainian Soim. Of the several parties sitting there, namely the UMP, USKhD and UDP, Vasyl has long been an integral figure of the new Ukrainian Statehood. Having got rid of the Hetman, the authorities in the country will finally be able to rely on the ideas of Ukrainian Conservatism, maybe even allow Vasyl to throw off the foreign stigma of the \"King\" and become a real Hetman of Ukraine."

ukrpol.4.t:0 "Our Economy"
ukrpol.4.d:0 "The economy of Ukraine is predominantly agrarian. In 1918, Land commissions were established, including the Supreme Land Commission, chaired by Skoropadskyi, to resolve land disputes and develop a land reform project.\n\nA stable currency and tax system were established, the state budget was developed and executed, State and Land Banks were created. Private land ownership, including the one for the large landowners, was restored, the peasants' ownership of land was confirmed with the allocation and sale of communal lands, which contributed to the formation of a broad class of medium-sized landowners. However, the state grain monopoly imposed by the Germans remained. The Skoropadskyi’s government relied on the restoration of large landlords and middle peasant farms, in which the German-Austrian occupation authorities were also interested. Supporting the Hetman, the landlords declared that small peasant farms were not able to provide large-scale commercial production of agricultural products, as demanded by war-ravaged Germany and Austria-Hungary from Ukraine. The soon-established supplies of industrial goods and agricultural implements to Ukraine from these countries helped ease the tense political and socio-economic situation in Ukrainian society.\n\nBy 1936, Ukraine had become one of the most promising economies in Europe, receiving a lot of money and investments from European powers. Industrial enterprises were restored and new ones were gradually created. However, there is only one fear - what if Europe stops buying our bread?"
ukrpol.4.a:0 "I doubt they will stop."

ukrpol.5.d:0 "The Christmas festivities are over, and today was the first meeting of the Soim after the New Year's break. The session was opened in person by King Vasyl, who addressed parliament and announced the need for a new budget for the year. His speech was met with skepticism by the majority consisting of members of the ruling Hetman's Party, the SHD. However, the King's supporters, the USKhD and UMP cheerfully applauded the King's speech, hastening to assure that Ukraine will be even richer and more successful this year."

ukrpol.7.d:0 "Derzhavna Warta presented its annual report for the past year to Hetman Skoropadsky personally, noting its merits in the fight against sabotage and terrorism on the territory of the Kingdom. The situation was especially tense in Odessa, where, according to the head of the State Guard, organized crime and banditry were rampant. Funded, according to Getman, by both French syndicalists and Romanian legionnaires, the troubled region has been at the center of various scandals for years. Measures must be taken to eliminate crime as quickly as possible."

ukrpol.9.d:0 "The German command in Kiev, known as the German Garrison, was withdrawn to Berlin as a result of Black Monday. For the first time since 1918 German troops, though no longer as numerous, left the country entirely.\n\nThere is already speculation as to what the political consequences of this decision will be, but in the absence of German control over Ukraine, anything can happen. In any case, the political forces have already begun to consolidate and prepare for anything."
ukrpol.9.a:0 "It's time to act."

ukrpol.10.t:0 "Dualism"
ukrpol.10.d:0 "The Ukrainian political system, according to many, is imperfect. On the one hand, the Hetman is quite an influential figure with many powers, but on the other hand his ambitions are limited by Soim and the presence of the King. Hetman has long dreamed of returning to the days when his power over Ukraine was virtually unlimited, and his place was not occupied by an Austrian impostor.\n\nOn the other hand, the King and Soim's opposition parties are dissatisfied with Hetman's power and believe that his presence interferes with the normal functioning of parliament. In any case, it has often come to a conflict, and now is the best moment to settle the matter once and for all."

ukrpol.11.t:0 "In Search of Reliable Allies"
ukrpol.11.d:0 "In Ukraine, which has been almost completely cleansed of any political opposition, the Hetman regime is left with few rivals, and thus few potential allies.\n\nOn the one hand, our main ally in the parliament is Lypynskyi, the main ideologist of Ukrainian conservatism, who came into conflict with Hetman back in the mid-20's and opposed his autocratic rule. Now he is not only the leader of the Sojm opposition, but also the main critic of the regime and supporter of the king. An alliance with his party, the USHD, is probably the most favorable prospect for us.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also dissatisfied Hetman among the Ukrainian armed forces. In particular, this is the Ukrainian Military Organization under the leadership of Konovalets. At first disarmed by Hetman, the Sichi Streltsy detachments were soon restored and had a significant influence on the formation of the armed forces. However, Konovalets himself, who holds more nationalistic views than Hetman, hardly supports Hetman."

ukrpol.12.d:0 "King Vasyl had long thought that the Hetman was only in the way. The political system in which he finds himself is completely devoid of any transparency or honesty, and Hetman does everything to ensure that neither the Parliament nor the King has any influence on important political decisions. This must come to an end. A conspiracy against Hetman is brewing. This man must not remain in power, otherwise Ukraine will be in distress. It is necessary to look for allies to solve the problem of imperfect Ukrainian politics."
ukrpol.12.a:0 "The Hetman should go or be forced to go!"

ukrpol.13.t:0 "UVO Activities in Galicia"
ukrpol.13.d:0 "After the Ukrainian Military Organization was established, one of Konovalets' main associates, Andriy Melnyk, was sent to Galicia, where he headed the local militarized units of Ukrainian Streltsy. Now that we have joined together in a conspiracy against the Hetman with Konovalets, he insists that Melnyk should return to Ukraine and help us in the rebellion."

ukrpol.15.t:0 "Note of Protest From Poland"
ukrpol.15.d:0 "Upon learning of the requisitioning of Polish farms, the Polish government sent us a strong note of protest and expelled a couple of diplomats from their country. They demand that the nationalized property of citizens of Polish nationality be immediately returned to them or compensated.

It is planned to raid the governor-general's palace, the official residence of the Hetman and arrest him. In doing so, however, we may come face to face with Derzhavna Varta, who serves, among other things, as the Hetman's personal guard. By accomplishing the coup quickly and with less blood, we will save the country from a full-fledged civil war."

This way, according to Vasyl, Lypynskyi would be safe, because the Hetman would not dare to encroach on the royal advisor without causing an international scandal involving Austria and Germany. Now Hetman's hands are virtually tied, and even if he banned Lypynskyi's party, we can be sure of his personal safety.\n\nMoreover, the position of royal advisor, despite its formality, also gives Lypynskyi the right to officially represent the king."

One of the bullets pierced his lung and the other hit his heart, causing Konovalets to die on the spot, bleeding to death. The unknown assailant managed to escape and his whereabouts are still unknown. Derzhavna Varta officially ordered an investigation into the premeditated murder and promised to do everything possible to find the culprit.\n\nThe king spoke on the radio, deploring the death of one of the best sons of the fatherland, a defender of Ukraine and a hero.

As proof, they said that they did not have sufficient funds and influence to carry out such a complex operation in the depths of Ukraine, since they were in Galicia. \n\nHowever, our management is not ready to accept this evidence, at least not yet, from an unrecognized Dyrektoria. On the other hand, a clearly anti-Austrian Hetman is unlikely to cooperate further with the Empire and prefer Germany or a much more serious opponent to it. We can provide guarantees and even some assistance to the Dyrektoria, but in exchange we will insist on restoring the throne, or, more realistically, on preferential grain supplies. We will need clear guarantees, and if they are not fulfilled, we must be ready to enforce them."

It was a pretty straightforward operation and we should have understood that. \n\nThe Directory offers Germany not to interfere in the internal Ukrainian conflict and not to support any of the parties, however, we clearly understand that the Directory's socialist government may actually be radically opposed to us and bring socialists to power in our largest European partner and stab them in the back. It would be a very risky step, but we can make it clear to them that if we support them, and they treacherously abandon us, Germany will take force and restore pro-Hetman forces. \n\nGuarantees of Ukraine's loyalty will consist in the resumption of exclusive supplies to Germany."

Despite our efforts to pacify Rivne, spontaneous rallies were held there today under the banners of the Directory and demanding the convening of an All-Ukrainian Constituent Assembly.

Our minister of security has just received a telegram from a socialist group claiming responsibility for mining His yacht, stating that the action was as a result of their exclusion from the democratic process. There was no chance to save our King and already the country has been plunged into disorder.\n\nThe Hetman, now alone with an empty throne, has announced that soon the Heir to the throne would be chosen by the Regency Council, headed by him, and the succession issues all to be resolved.\n\nBefore it happens, though, he has announced that he will stay as the Supreme Leader, with Martial Law still in effect."

He was forced to retire and abdicate his claims to the Hetmanate. The King has announced that the power in the country is to be transfered to the elected Ukrainian Soim. In Germany, the events were perceived ambiguously, dubbing the events as a coup d'état."

ukrpol.100.d:0 "Today the Hetman of All Ukraine, Pavlo Skoropadskyi, arrived in Vienna with an official delegation. Such a high-ranking meeting may indicate that the Hetman has something to tell our government about the terrible act of terrorism that took place on the Dnieper River, and which resulted in the death of the King of Ukraine, Vasyl, known as Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen. \n\nThe hetman announced that the main accused had already been found and that they were taking refuge in Galicia. Known as the Direktoria, they represent a kind of body claiming power in all of Ukraine. The Directory consists of various kinds of Ukrainian nationalists and socialists, who prefer to organize terror. Hetman cited much evidence of their active anti-monarchist activities prior to the explosion on the Dnieper.\n\nIn this regard, Hetman once again expressed his condolences to the royal house of Habsburg, and moved on to more pressing issues, namely the question of the belonging of Galicia and the Ukrainians living there. He said that under Ukrainian supervision the Directory based there would be defeated, of which we can have no doubt."

The nephew of Vasyl, Leo Stefan Habsburg and Danylo Skoropadskyi, son of the deposed Hetman, are both contenders for the throne.

He well remembers the previous crisis in 1919, when the Hetmanate was at the great risk of famine because of the Germans. The almost unaffordable demands for grain supplies from Austria and Germany led to the fact that the peasants had practically nothing left, which led to the aggravation of their situation, the strengthening of opposition to the Hetman, the growth of anarchism, banditry and crime. Fortunately, famine was avoided then. If we do not terminate our contracts with Germany now, which actually provide benefits for trade with us to all the countries of Mitteleurope, we may find ourselves in a similar situation again. It is necessary to act immediately, while Germany is weak and cannot fight back against us. We must immediately get out of the economic bloc and raise the prices of our goods, and we don't care where they get the money for it."

ukreco.6.d:0 "The many upheavals of the past two years have caused the government to pay little or no attention to the developing agricultural crisis. The overproduction resulting from falling demand and rising prices resulted in farmers planting too many crops last year that they could not sell. In addition, the crisis was exacerbated by a lack of adequate government assistance. Although the German monopoly on bread, with the tacit consent of Skoropadskyi, made Ukrainian peasants and landowners rich, it also made Ukraine seriously dependent on the European market, which was forced to refuse to buy Ukrainian products in the harsh times of crisis.\n\nNow, in 1938, there was a huge exodus of peasants to the cities, and the sowing season was practically disrupted. Excessive grain harvests have led to mass spoilage of foodstuffs. Famine was already beginning in some rural areas. The situation is no longer under our control, but necessary measures should be taken as soon as possible!"

On account of our dependency, our farmers aren't able to develop their own businesses and compete with well-funded German freeholders, many of whom hold key positions in our economy.

Almost vaudeville confusion leads to the creation of numerous comic situations in which the characters, who find themselves in \"alien\" eras, live according to the laws of their time. \n\nIt turns out that Koretskyi is surprisingly similar to the Hetman, which is noticed by Myloslavskyi, who, posing as Prince Golytsyn, convinces Koretskyi to play the role of Hetman. Koretskyi, being an ardent supporter of modern politics, causes insurmountable horror among the Cossacks by publicly renouncing Peter the Great and his 'Muscovy' and declaring an alliance with the Teutons.\n\nAt the same time in XX Century Kyiv, Hetman Skoropadskyi at first rejoices to learn that his descendant rules the country, but then he is horrified to learn that the Austrian Archduke is sitting at the head of the country as a King, and German garrisons are walking around the city. \n\nThe play ends with everything falling back into place, and Tymofeenko wakes up.

Critics have already praised the film, saying that it is the best that the director has shot in his career.\n\nDovzhenko declared himself as an interesting and original master in 1928 with the film \"Zvenyhora\", where episodes of Ukrainian history were intertwined with scenes of the Civil War, where revolutionary epic, satire and lyrics were combined. According to critics, "Zvenyhora" marked the birth of Ukrainian cinema as an art. In 1929, Dovzhenko shot \"Arsenal\", the story of the uprising of the workers of the Kyiv factory in 1918. Then he himself took part in those riots, though on the other side, but in the film he seems to repent that he was blinded by Bolshevik fairy tales. In this film Dovzhenko continued to create his own unique language at the junction of poetic and realistic cinema. In terms of the scope and epicness of the action, Arsenal is not inferior to Zvenyhora - masses of people, many ordinary deaths and one grandiose one in the finale of the film, when the hero takes a blow from the enemy with his bare chest."

Already in the autumn of 1917, the gang of a Yaponchik made a number of daring raids, including robbing a Romanian gambling club during the day. On New Year's Day in 1918, Goldstein's store and the sugar factory owner Yu. Gepner were robbed.\n\nAt the same time, Yaponchik organized the so-called Jewish Revolutionary Self-Defense Squad under the pretext of fighting possible pogroms and issued a \"proclamation\" calling for robbing \"only the bourgeoisie and officers.\" In November 1917, one of the robbers was even killed by the Yaponchik himself for robbing a worker.\n\nHe established contacts with the Odessa anarchist movement and in early December 1917, a group of so-called \"anarchist-rippers\" (\"rippers off the bourgeoisie\") appeared in Odessa, who staged a powerful explosion on Deribasovskaya Street in 1917, demanding an end to lynching of captured bandits. Later the bandits seized Eisenberg's brothel on Dvoryanskaya Street, setting up their headquarters there.\n\nIn January 1918, Yaponchik's squad, together with the Bolsheviks, anarchists and left SRS, participated in street battles. The bandits took advantage of these events to raid the Registration Bureau of the police, during which a card file for 16 thousand Odessa criminals was burned.\n\nAt the beginning of 1919, he actively collaborated with the Bolshevik underground. During the Civil War, the Yaponchik gang committed many new daring robberies, also engaged in kidnappings and racketeering. A number of entrepreneurs who did not want to pay the bandits were killed. In February 1919, a daring raid was made on a Civil public meeting of Odessa during a gala dinner, the apartment of Duchess Lyubomirskaya and the room of the Spanish consul at the Londonskyi Hotel were also robbed.\n\nYaponchik invested the money earned from crime in real business: he bought the most luxurious restaurant in Odessa. A casino and a brothel functioned under him.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, this open banditry of Yaponchik ended and he lay low, successfully eluding the Derzhavna Varta. However, recently our valiant law enforcement officers managed to raid an underground casino, presumably owned by Yaponchik. Unfortunately, once again, he himself was not there."

The main characters are the Russian officers and Ukrainian citizens that participated in the defence of Kyiv from those disloyal to the new regime of Ukrainian Nationalists and different socialist groups comprised of soldiers in the army of Hetman Skoropadskyi. The film analyses the relations between the Russians and the Ukrainians. Conceived by Bulhakov as a symbol of national reconciliation, 'The White Guard' encourages the unity of the Kingdom and friendship of its people, though some radical groups of the local nationalists consider this film to be Russian propaganda."

The film, which was conceived to be an answer to the Bulgakov's 'White Guard' doesn't try to point out possible methods of reconciliation, but raises by implication the potential for separatists and spies of foreign powers to still be hiding among the Ukrainian population and both willing and able to try to exploit its weakness."

### King is dead - Hetman is in power ###
UKR_Explosion_Dnieper:0 "Explosion on the Dnieper"
UKR_Explosion_Dnieper_desc:0 "The death of the King has come as a shock to us all, and now one question remains - in what direction will our nation travel in the aftermath?"

UKR_Outlaw_Radicalism:0 "Start the Kyiv Trials"
UKR_Outlaw_Radicalism_desc:0 "With the explosion on the Dnieper, a wave of political repression begins in the kingdom. From Skoropadskyi's point of view - a fair trial for all those involved. Of course, their guilt will be established by the court, but who says that the evidence will not be enough?"
UKR_Settle_the_Austrian_Issues:0 "Settle the Austrian Diplomatic Crisis"
UKR_Settle_the_Austrian_Issues_desc:0 "After the explosion on the Dnieper, relations with the Austrian Empire were strained, as Vienna believed that our state had failed to cope with the terrorist threat. We need to restore diplomacy, at least conditionally."
UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy:0 "Ukrainian Unity"
UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy_desc:0 "The relations between the Russians and the Ukrainians in Ukraine are good enough, but various powers try to depict them as an eternal struggle between the West and the East. We must stop this chauvinistic propaganda, but our aim is also to show that despite the common past and good relations with Russia, we are independent now and will always be."
UKR_Look_Out_To_Russia:0 "Look Out to Russia"
UKR_Look_Out_To_Russia_desc:0 "With the collapse of the German economy, perhaps we should look eastward to Russia, which is rising from the ashes. The Russophile wing of the SHD particularly insists on this"
UKR_Threaten_Germany:0 "Threaten the Kaiserreich"
UKR_Threaten_Germany_desc:0 "Enough to be satisfied with the German hosts. We are an independent country and we will dictate terms to Germany ourselves, if they want to receive stable grain from us."
UKR_Prohibit_Syndicalism:0 "Prohibit Syndicalism"
UKR_Prohibit_Syndicalism_desc:0 "We have reached an understanding with the pro-Russian circles, pacified the various Ukrainian movements and helped make the peasantry loyal to us. Now we have to deal with the Socialists. Our mass media will start a massive propaganda campaign, showing the Syndies as a malignant tumour on Slavdom. Our efforts will eventually enable us to ban many notorious left parties."
UKR_Federalisation:0 "Decentralization Under Supervision"
UKR_Federalisation_desc:0 "The Socialists, Nationalists and the Russophiles have all tried to impose their ideas on the whole country. This has demonstrated the flaws of the centralised approach of the Hetmanate. If we give our regions more autonomy and weaken the Supreme Rada, we will be able to stop regional debates becoming flashpoints on the national stage to ensure political chaos remains a thing of the past."
UKR_Peasant_State:0 "The Peasant State"
UKR_Peasant_State_desc:0 "Our peasants have always played a significant role in the country and its economy. With extra money available from our reduced military spending, we can reduce taxes for the poor until our agriculture recovers from Black Monday and we will become the breadbasket of Europe once again."
UKR_Army_Reforms:0 "Draft an Army Reform"
UKR_Army_Reforms_desc:0 "It is obvious that the Ukrainian army is incomparable to the Russian and German behemoths, and yet it is still stronger than any neighbouring army. That's why Skoropadskyi has proposed re-orientating our army towards a smaller professional force. It will help us maintain our security, and will allow us to reduce our costly defence spending."
UKR_End_The_Martial_Law:0 "End the Martial Law"
UKR_End_The_Martial_Law_desc:0 "The state of emergency imposed by Hetman is coming to an end. For now, this does not mean the return of the Sejm, nor does it affect the state of affairs in the country, except for a sense of some calm and stability"
UKR_Restore_Vilne_Kozatstvo:0 "Restore the Vilne Kozatstvo"
UKR_Restore_Vilne_Kozatstvo_desc:0 "The Vilne Kozatstvo or the Free Cossacks emerged as civil defense detachments and territorial paramilitary formations defending the independence of Ukraine. In accordance with the demand of the German occupation command, in April 1918, the Hetman had to disarm the Free Cossacks. However, now that our country has become stronger and more independent, it is time to revive this movement, for it is the essence of our power!"
UKR_Revive_Ukrainisation:0 "Revive Ukrainisation"
UKR_Revive_Ukrainisation_desc:0 "In recent years the pace of Ukrainianization has slowed down a bit, but our state needs the growth of national consciousness, the development of Ukrainian culture and science. It is necessary to take measures to actualize the Ukrainian national movement."
UKR_Regency_Council:0 "Convene the Regency Council"

UKR_Legacy_Of_Imperial_Russia_desc:0 "The order of pre-revolutionary Russia remained fairly common in Russia, but with the advent of the Austrian king, an increasingly pro-Western way of life and lifestyle was adopted. Skoropadsky believes that the tsarist regime brought many good things and that the old orders should be restored"
UKR_Finish_The_Banditry:0 "Blow to the Organized Crime"
UKR_Finish_The_Banditry_desc:0 "Rampant crime, especially in Odessa, was still a serious problem. However, since we have strengthened Derzhavna Varta, we will have no difficulty in destroying crime in Ukraine!"

UKR_Reform_Derzhavna_Varta_desc:0 "Derzhavna Varta, Ukraine's police and security service, needs reform. Our custodians of law and order must be well equipped and trained to face any threats to our stability"
UKR_Restructure_The_Bureaucracy:0 "Bureaucratic Overhaul"
UKR_Restructure_The_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "The bureaucratic apparatus, thanks to the efforts of Soim and Korol, became essentially their main stronghold in the regions. They still remain in place, hindering Skoropadsky's effective policies. It is necessary to replace them with loyal subalterns and to establish contact between the regions and the central government"
UKR_Support_The_Protofis:0 "Support the Protofis"

UKR_The_New_Ukrainian_Aristocracy_desc:0 "Similarly to Tsarist Russia, a new aristocracy was forming in our country - from among the large landowners and industrialists. They are one of the pillars of our regime and it is necessary to ascertain their loyalty to Skoropadskyi."
UKR_Ukrainian_Agrarism_Skoropadsky:0 "Ukrainian Agrarianism"
UKR_Ukrainian_Agrarism_Skoropadsky_desc:0 "Despite the support of large landowners, Skoropadsky understands how important it is not to forget the peasants and farmers. By supporting private small farmers, we will ensure the popular support of Skoropadsky and the development of our economy."
UKR_Ukrainian_Church_Significant:0 "Magnify the Ukrainian Church Significance"
UKR_Ukrainian_Church_Significant_desc:0 "The independent Ukrainian Church is one of the major achievements of Skoropadsky's rule. The church plays an important role in the national self-determination of Ukrainians and should be supported."
UKR_Science_Development_Grants:0 "Science Development Grants"

### Economy Focuses ###
UKR_Agricultural_Crisis:0 "Agricultural Crisis Reaction"
UKR_Agricultural_Crisis_desc:0 "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered the Ukrainian economy and stability in the country. The King barely controls the country, those loyal to the Hetman peasants want land reforms, pro-Russian forces and Nationalists demand radical measures and the Socialists mobilise their supporters all over the country...""
UKR_Stabilize_Hryvnia:0 "Stabilize the Hryvnia"
UKR_Stabilize_Hryvnia_desc:0 "For the first time, hryvnia was released into circulation on October 17, 1918. Initially, the hryvnia was supposed to play the role of domestic loan bonds. However, the shortage of banknotes in circulation led to the fact that both bonds and individual coupons began to be used as money at the beginning of 1919. During this time, the economy has stabilized and many of the efforts of former Finance Minister Anton Rzhepetskyi to stabilize the national Ukrainian currency have been justified. However, due to Black Monday, the situation has worsened. Urgent measures must be taken to stabilize the Hryvnia!"
UKR_deposit_protection_law:0 "Empower Derzhavnyi Bank"
UKR_deposit_protection_law_desc:0 "By 1936, a wide network of credit and banking institutions with a multi-level structure was created in the country, which covered all branches of the agrarian-industrial economy of the region. It ensured the normal movement of goods, money and credit resources, although its power was significantly inferior to similar systems of industrial and industrial-agrarian countries of Western Europe. However, now our system needs additional support from the state. By giving extra powers to the Derzhavnyi (State) Bank, we can make sure it can bail out failing commercial banks."
UKR_Rural_Credit_Banks:0 "Rural Credit Banks"
UKR_Rural_Credit_Banks_desc:0 "With the agricultural crisis raging, credit is not a popular thing in the rural areas. The State Land Bank refused to give credits directly to the farms, being on the edge of default. We should establish rural banking systems, created to give poor peasants access to much-needed financial support and credit."
UKR_Continue_The_Mechanisation_Efforts:0 "Regional Tractor Stations"
UKR_Continue_The_Mechanisation_Efforts_desc:0 "In the modern day and age, hand tools and ploughs are being replaced by tractors and machines. With Germany stopping their deliveries, it is time for us to establish domestic production. Let us establish a system of leasing and borrowing state-owned tractors to improve agrarian productivity!"
UKR_Invest_In_KhTZ:0 "Open the Kharkiv Tractor Plant"
UKR_Invest_In_KhTZ_desc:0 "As part of our agricultural mechanisation process, we need the industry to support it as demand for tractors, spare parts, and maintenance sharply rise. Thankfully, the KhTZ, a constructed tractor factory will specialize in this industrial sector. We should finish the constructing and aid the new complex so that they will be able to meet these growing demands with more ease."
UKR_Resume_Cash_Crop_Exportation:0 "Resume Cash Crop Exportation"
UKR_Resume_Cash_Crop_Exportation_desc:0 "Ukraine retains a very agrarian economy, but the recent economic troubles did severe damage to our major agricultural exports. With the economy market prices largely stabilised, we can resume agricultural exports and invest these profits."
UKR_Nationalize_NUSK:0 "Nationalise NUSK"
UKR_Nationalize_NUSK_desc:0 "The German-Ukrainian Agricultural Commission, an organisation, that ensured Ukrainian crops will reach the customers in Mitteleuropa, has been established in 1923, with the majority of shares be German. Now that we are free from German watch, this company needs to fall to Ukrainian hands."
UKR_Prospecting_In_Donbas:0 "Donbas Mining-Industrial Complex"
UKR_Prospecting_In_Donbas_desc:0 "The Donbas region in Ukraine is rich in coal and is one of the most developed industrial centers even now. But as our government foresees, it can be expanded even further."
UKR_State_Sponsored_Construction_Works:0 "State-Sponsored Construction Works"
UKR_State_Sponsored_Construction_Works_desc:0 "To industrialize the country and do so fast, the state needs to direct money and resources towards construction projects which are critical to the economy of the state and so need to be finished quickly. Let us create a system of these works and help the Ukrainian economy grow."
UKR_rural_development:0 "Rural Infrastructure Initiatives"
UKR_rural_development_desc:0 "The Ukrainian countryside continues to struggle, many regions remain destitute, and the Black Monday Crisis has not given it any favours. We must dedicate investment to roads and irrigation in the countryside to improve the life of the poor average peasant!"
UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery:0 "Begin Ukrainian Recovery"
UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery_desc:0 "Social problems always provoke political instability. Lots of peasants join Socialist, nationalist or Russian separatist movements because of awful living conditions. If we want to save Ukraine from collapse, we should start a recovery programme and help the poorest grain-growers in Central Ukraine, providing our population with the cheap electricity they require. For this, we need cash."
UKR_First_Loan:0 "German Loan For Electrification"
UKR_First_Loan_desc:0 "We should ask Germany for a loan, which we will be able to use for the electrification of the the poorest grain-growers. By doing so we will improve their living conditions and help modernise their production methods. They must understand that the situation in Ukraine is unstable and it is important to help us, since we secure German interests in the East."
UKR_First_TaxHike:0 "Taxes For The Electrification"
UKR_First_TaxHike_desc:0 "We must use our own resources and raise taxes, since there is no other way to get investment for the programme of the electrification of the villages in the Central Ukraine. We hope that our peasants will understand us."
UKR_Electrification:0 "New Resources"
UKR_Electrification_desc:0 "Our government has finally been able to electrify all the villages in Central Ukraine. As a result our peasants will be able to produce more agricultural goods and supplies. Now we also need more resources, to fuel our nation's recovery and create the tools to do it."
UKR_Second_Loan:0 "German Loan For Industrialisation"
UKR_Second_Loan_desc:0 "We have improved the situation in Central Ukraine - it's time to do something in the Eastern part of the country. All the factories built by the Tsarist government should be modernised as fast as possible. But we need investment and technological support from our ally in Berlin!"
UKR_Second_TaxHike:0 "Taxes For The Industrialisation"
UKR_Second_TaxHike_desc:0 "Electricity is available all over the Central Ukraine - now it's time to rebuild industry in the Eastern part of the country. All the factories built by the Tsarist government should be modernised as fast as possible. And that's why we have to raise taxes. Again."
UKR_Kharkov_Industry:0 "Kharkov Industrial Zone"
UKR_Kharkov_Industry_desc:0 "Kharkov has always been one of the most populated cities in Ukraine, but we have never used this advantage in our economy. Now is a perfect time to launch the formation of a new industrial region in the Kharkov region and finally make our industry strong!"
UKR_Yekaterinoslav_Industry:0 "Invest in Katerinoslav"
UKR_Yekaterinoslav_Industry_desc:0 "Despite Kharkov is a nice place to develop our industy, its closeness to the Russian borders can become truly a disadvantage. Instead, we shall relocate our efforts to the Katerinoslav region, in the central part of our country."
UKR_Stab_econ:0 "Invest in the Western Regions"
UKR_Stab_econ_desc:0 "Thanks to our elaborate measures, we revived our economy and mitigated the consequences of the Black Monday for Ukraine. We can hope that our economy will soon prove itself to be competitive throughout Europe."


UKR_progressive_taxation:0 "Implement Progressive Taxation"
UKR_progressive_taxation_desc:0 "It is not fair that an impoverished peasant, a toiling worker and a wealthy businessman all pay the same portion of their salary to the treasury. The more well off must help those in need, and we shall make this state policy, implementing a system of progressive taxation."
UKR_traditional_agrarianism:0 "Promote Traditional Agrarianism"
UKR_traditional_agrarianism_desc:0 "As we progress to the modern era, we must never forget that human beings are naturally attached to the land, and prosper the most as individual landholders in the countryside. We must never forget to support agriculture with subsidies, beneficial policies and parliament acts."
UKR_grain_trade_monopoly:0 "State Monopoly on Grain Trade"
UKR_grain_trade_monopoly_desc:0 "To ensure that the Bulgarian peasantry have access to fair grain sales and purchases, instead of being ripped off by greedy salesmen, the state shall legislate a monopoly in this sector. All sale and purchase of grain in the country shall be controlled by state-owned corporations which will keep the interests of the peasantry in mind."
UKR_protect_labor_rights:0 "Enforce Labour Rights Legislation"
UKR_protect_labor_rights_desc:0 "We must not only expand labour rights in Bulgaria, reducing the daily working hours, promoting unionisation and limiting dangerous labour, but we must also establish a system which enforces this legislation. Audits and independent ombudsmen will crack down on offending businesses and ensure that the rights of labour truly are protected."
UKR_state_production_monopolies:0 "Establish State Production Monopolies"
UKR_state_production_monopolies_desc:0 "Certain sections of the economy are too dangerous for private businesses to control and must be placed under sole state supervision. State production monopolies will ensure that prices are kept low and the interests of the people are always kept in mind."
UKR_free_trade_unions:0 "Empower the Free Trade Unions"
UKR_free_trade_unions_desc:0 "The Free Trade Unions are the trade union organisation of the Social Democratic Workers' Party, and represent the socialist side of legal organised labour in Bulgaria. We must empower this organisation by merging smaller trade unions into its aegis and prioritising its interests in business-union negotiations."
UKR_renew_urban_centres:0 "Renew Urban Centres"
UKR_renew_urban_centres_desc:0 "The urban populations of Sofia, Plovdiv, Burgas, Ruse and other cities are our arm of electoral support, hence we shall benefit them with additional funding. Urban centres shall be renewed and land clearances will allow cities to expand further into the countryside."
UKR_right_to_wealth:0 "The Right to Wealth"
UKR_right_to_wealth_desc:0 "Who are we to deny a thrifty, clever man the fruits of his labour? If he has established a business and built up sizeable wealth, then we can only endorse him and show him as an example, instead of taking that wealth away. After all, it is the businessman who creates jobs and employs those down-trodden."
UKR_agrarian_syndicalism:0 "Agrarian Syndicalism"
UKR_agrarian_syndicalism_desc:0 "Who dares to say that Syndicalism can only be accomplished in cities, among industrial workers? There is a revolutionary fire burning in every poor peasant, a dream of liberty and communal freedom, which we shall express! Those who work the land can follow Socialist principles of union supremacy and liberty just as well as their proletarian brothers!"
UKR_land_socialization:0 "Socialisation of the Land"
UKR_land_socialization_desc:0 "This land is our land. We shall begin to steer away from private land ownership and turn all land into property owned by the people. We shall encourage communes of peasantry which work common land and prosper with each other's effort, rather than working small plots individually."
UKR_agrarian_professional_unions:0 "Form Agricultural Professional Unions"
UKR_agrarian_professional_unions_desc:0 "We shall transform Vlasovden into a union congress uniting all agricultural workers, and establish trade unions for all agricultural professions. These unions shall be empowered to manage administrative issues in their respective field - the farmers' union shall deal with crop agriculture and the herders' union shall deal with animal husbandry, and so on."
UKR_federation_of_rural_communes:0 "A Federation of Rural Communes"
UKR_federation_of_rural_communes_desc:0 "Central government is the root of many evils in modern society - Bulgaria shall instead seek the liberty of local governance. It will be transformed into a federation of rural communes, and these communes will manage administrative issues in their region. A federal congress of communal representatives will replace the dilapidated Sŭbranie."
UKR_french_practices:0 "Replicate French Institutions"
UKR_french_practices_desc:0 "Though the Commune of France is based upon industrial unions, their experience in creating a practical Socialist state will be invaluable. We shall replicate the BGT, popular militias and the Federal Army of the Commune, among other institutions. This way, we shall further the cause of Syndicalism in the Balkans!"
UKR_collective_economy:0 "Communal Economic Organisation"
UKR_collective_economy_desc:0 "We must abandon the bourgeois concepts of profit-making and exploitation. The new Bulgaria shall place one's labour as the only source of value, and hand the control of economic processes to the local communes. Vouchers shall replace bourgeois currencies, though they will be adapted to use for exchange and foreign trade, and businesses shall be returned to their workers."
UKR_mutual_assistance_organisations:0 "Mutual Assistance Organisations"
UKR_mutual_assistance_organisations_desc:0 "Those who are less able and experienced must be taught by their more capable peers. Every commune in Socialist Bulgaria shall establish organisations of mutual existence where agricultural expertise and practical knowledge shall be taught and shared."
UKR_revolutionary_spirit:0 "Revolutionary Spirit of the Poor Peasantry"
UKR_revolutionary_spirit_desc:0 "Since times immemorial, the Bulgarian peasantry has possessed a revolutionary spirit. Ivaylo, the Tsar of the Peasants, rose to power on their backs, and the Turkish yoke was overthrown by the resistance of the common folk. This spirit shall be rejuvenated, and the Bulgarian peasantry prepare to export their revolutionary vigour abroad!"
UKR_village_militias:0 "Village Worker Militias"
UKR_village_militias_desc:0 "All communes in Socialist Bulgaria shall establish militias, and all peasantry will be trained to use weapons. In the case of foreign invasion, these militias will be our last line of defence, making the occupation of our plains and mountains hell for any tyrant."
UKR_modernization_priority:0 "Drive for Industrial Modernity"
UKR_modernization_priority_desc:0 "An agrarian state must become a modern, industrial state with a large proletariat before it can advance into socialism. We shall accomplish just that. Our regime will be one which drags Bulgaria into the modern era by force, turning millions of peasants into factory workers!"
UKR_anti_clericalism:0 "Escalate the Anti-Clerical Struggle"
UKR_anti_clericalism_desc:0 "The Orthodox Church is an enemy of the socialist revolution, opportunistically endorsing the Monarchist regime and agitating against our revolutionary government. We shall begin curtailing the Orthodox Church, removing opposition priests and putting in loyal puppets, while starting a mass atheization campaign to root out this superstition."
UKR_agricultural_collectives:0 "Establish Collective Farms"
UKR_agricultural_collectives_desc:0 "To ensure that the countryside is loyal to the socialist cause and provides the industrialising cities with sufficient foodstuffs, we shall replace individual land ownership with state-controlled collectives. These collectives will ensure the loyalty of the peasantry and make sure that the supply of produce is always secure."



### Focuses ###


UKR_Invite_Khrushchev:0 "Invite Khrushchev Into Government"
UKR_Invite_Khrushchev_desc:0 "Nikita Khrushchev, a well-known but controversial Ukrainian social-democrat, proposes the populist idea, very popular among the peasants, of the reorganisation of our agriculture. We have to admit, that that this proposition seems like it can help Ukraine in her time of crisis. Maybe we should invite him into government to implement these reforms?"
UKR_Popular_Front:0 "Popular Front"
UKR_Popular_Front_desc:0 "Though we have given Khrushchev free reign to reorganise the economy, many of our legislators in the Rada have prevented any attempt by Khrushchev to reduce the power of the Kulak landlords. That's why Khrushchev has announced a creation of the 'Popular Front', which will unite left members of the Supreme Rada and give him enough authority to change the laws."
UKR_Language_Issue:0 "Solve The Language Issue"
UKR_Language_Issue_desc:0 "The Russian language is widespread in Ukraine and the native tongue of many of our citizens, but it has never been an official state language. If we grant Russian a formal role in the Ukrainian state, it will allow us to gain popularity among pro-Russian citizens and solve one of the divisive issues our nation faces."
UKR_Exp_Kulaks:0 "Expropriate Kulak Holdings"
UKR_Exp_Kulaks_desc:0 "'Kulaks' or 'Kurkuls' is a category of relatively affluent farmers who are able to hire a lot of the poorest peasants and thus earn an enormous amount of money. Since they are hated by the majority of the peasants, we can easily expropriate they lands and divide them between the poorest peasants in the country."
UKR_Tax_Kulaks:0 "Increase Kulak Taxation"
UKR_Tax_Kulaks_desc:0 "'Kulaks' or 'Kurkuls' is a category of relatively affluent farmers who are able to hire a lot of the poorest peasants and thus earn an enormous amount of money. Since they are the only group of the farmers that are still able to fulfil our consumer needs, it would be wise to let them have their lands, but to impose an additional tax on them."
UKR_Coll_Prog:0 "Collectivisation"
UKR_Coll_Prog_desc:0 "After the latest agricultural crisis among the 'Kulaks', we have many new poor peasants all over Ukraine. Khrushchev proposes that they can work on new collective farms and produce goods for the state, which will provide them with farming tools and pay them a reasonable salary. This should hopefully, through pooling of resources, boost our total output."
UKR_Fate_Monarchy:0 "Fate of the Monarchy"
UKR_Fate_Monarchy_desc:0 "King Vasily has become somewhat of a laughing stock to the Ukrainian people. By handing major powers to Krushchev and seeing more issues solved in months than the King himself had resolved in years he has only highlighted his own irrelevance. A former Austrian puppet king with no Austrian backing, his position is being openly debated by Popular Front members."
UKR_Syn_Rev:0 "A Red Hetman"
UKR_Syn_Rev_desc:0 "As the great Hetman Bogdan Khmelnitskyi, who once liberated people on both banks of the Dnieper from the Polish yoke, once did; Nikita Khrushchev and the Popular Front deposed the King, the Hetman, and purged the Rada of all elements not willing to embrace the new reality. Finally the people of Ukraine are ready to build new society, one both proud and free!"
UKR_Friendship_Nations:0 "Unite the People"
UKR_Friendship_Nations_desc:0 "The capitalists did their best to divide the people of Ukraine, imposing chauvinism and intolerance on the national minorities of our country. But new leadership with Khrushchev is ready to fight this deception and will encourage a policy of unity amongst all citizens of this great nation!"
UKR_Khrushchyovka:0 "'Khrushchyovka'"
UKR_Khrushchyovka_desc:0 "'Khrushchyovka' is the unofficial designation for a type of low-cost, concrete-panelled three to five-storied apartment building developed at the request of our leader Nikita Khrushchev. Mass production of these structures should finally solve the housing problem in the rapidly expanding Ukrainian cities and will provide more employment and accommodation to the masses."
UKR_Remove_Khrushchev:0 "Purge Khrushchev"
UKR_Remove_Khrushchev_desc:0 "The recent denigration of the royal position has demonstrated that Krushchev and his Popular Front partners are an unacceptable threat to King and Country. We will remove them from all of their offices in a major purge with the Hetman's backing. Once done, we will have to abolish their most radical laws and start to re-calibrate our economy."

UKR_comrade_devotion:0 "Comrade Devotion"
UKR_comrade_devotion_desc:0 "Ukraine is whole once more, the nation united in support of Khrushchev’s policies, this nation-wide strive for excellence has created an atmosphere of hard work. Across Ukraine in factories, farms, mines, ports, stores there are dedicated workers forging a new Ukraine!"
UKR_wealth_distribute:0 "Distribute Our New Wealth"
UKR_wealth_distribute_desc:0 "Profits gained from the new Kulak taxes will be distributed amongst the poorer labourers in order to decrease economic division. Providing workers with a higher income will boost popularity for Khrushchev and raise the living standards for many. Greed has polluted the nation, it is time for equality for all!"
UKR_new_society:0 "New Ukrainian Society"
UKR_new_society_desc:0 "A nation of true freedom, happiness and equality! A united proletariat represented both in the fields labouring and in the government dictating. Now we can declare the foundation of a new nation, one that is directed by socialism!"
UKR_peasant_army:0 "Revolutionary Peasants' Army"
UKR_peasant_army_desc:0 "The military of the Ukranian state was mostly composed of reactionary and nationalist commanders, when comrade Khrushchev seized power many of these generals refused to serve under a socialist republican. Therefore Khrushchev has restructured the military into a mass fighting force of proletariat, they may lack in experience whoever they are loyal comrades!"


UKR_Broad_Coalition:0 "Coalition With The Nationalists"
UKR_Broad_Coalition_desc:0 "Realising the scale of the Socialist threat, Hetman Skoropadskyi decided to strike a bargain with the pro-Russian 'ViN' and nationalist 'SUN'. Both parties will get freedom of action in regions where they are especially popular, but in return they will support Skoropadskyi's regime and the King in the Rada through a 'confidence and supply' agreement."
UKR_Rightist_Government:0 "Initial Administrative Reforms"
UKR_Rightist_Government_desc:0 "Members of 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have begun to replace Hetman-period officials in the regions en-masse, somewhat upsetting the balance of the Rada. Surprisingly, this has had a positive effect on our economy because eager new local governments are keen to solve the problems afflicting their own towns. The first steps of reform are underway."
UKR_ViN_Russophiles:0 "Church and Nation"
UKR_ViN_Russophiles_desc:0 "It seems that Mykhailo Bulhakov, with the help of 'ViN', has finally found a method by which the land question can be resolved amicably. The Ukrainian Church, which is a part of the Russian Orthodox Church, will sell vast swathes of mostly unoccupied lands to the peasants at a discount, but Orthodoxy will be recognised as the formal state religion in Ukraine."
UKR_Abolish_Law:0 "Recognise Russian"
UKR_Abolish_Law_desc:0 "One of the biggest problems which exists in Ukraine is the language question. De-facto, the Russian language is used by a majority of the population, but its usage is prohibited by the state institutions. 'ViN' has always opposed this prohibition and thus it is with great pleasure that Mykhailo Bulhakov is now able to abolish this language law."
UKR_Prosvita_Mov:0 "The Prosvita Movement"
UKR_Prosvita_Mov_desc:0 "Unfortunately, a sizeable percentage of our population use the Russian language despite the fact that the government doesn't recognise it at a state level for use in national institutions. To combat this, 'SUN' has proposed to invest in a 'Prosvita' ('Education') movement. The aim of 'Prosvita' is to spread Ukrainian language and culture throughout the country, as well as abroad."
UKR_Free_Trade:0 "Eastern Free Trade Area"
UKR_Free_Trade_desc:0 "The free trade area with Ukraine has shown its benefits. The borderlands which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg are full of collieries and ironworks now. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
UKR_Crisis_Coalition:0 "Crisis in the Coalition"
UKR_Crisis_Coalition_desc:0 "Though the Socialist threat has mostly melted away due to government reforms, 'ViN' and 'SUN' have gained too much popularity among the citizens of Ukraine and their followers are inadvertently violently splitting our country apart with their nationalistic fervour.

UKR_Dissolve_Rada:0 "Dissolve the Rada"
UKR_Dissolve_Rada_desc:0 "Our Supreme Rada (Parliament) has always been too left and never really supported Skoropadskyi's policies as Hetman.

UKR_Agrarian_Reform:0 "Agrarian Reform"
UKR_Agrarian_Reform_desc:0 "Now that we have a mandate from the people, it is time to take back control of our farms from the German oligarchs. The government has devised a program which provides an incentive system for existing landowners to sell their farmland to the government at above the market rate, from which smaller parcels will then be provided to Ukrainian citizens. Furthermore, we have received permission from the German government to sell our grain outside of the Mitteleuropan sphere, provided these other nations are not considered a direct threat to the Reichspakt and exports to the German sphere take priority."

UKR_Curb_Executive:0 "Limit The Executive Powers"
UKR_Curb_Executive_desc:0 "The executive powers have always been a bit too strong and this allowed extreme reactionaries to dominate state affairs.

### Events ###
ukraine.1.t:0 "Our Kingdom"
ukraine.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Ukraine proclaimed its independence with German support on 25th January 1918, a state of affairs that was quickly ratified by the Peace of Nations agreement at Brest-Litovsk. An initial experiment with socialism in the form of a People's Republic was swiftly expunged by a German-backed coup. This operation, led by the strongman and former general in the Russian army Pavlo Skoropadskyi, set the tone for Ukraine's future. It was to be a breadbasket used by a military-aristocrat elite from across Eastern Europe as a source of food, a convenient market for goods and a military bulwark against the weakened Russian Republic. For a time the dispute between Germany and its Austro-Hungarian ally over Ukrainian rumbled on after the Weltkrieg, eventually settling on a compromise whereby King Vasily, an Austrian archduke born Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, would rule with the support of Skoropadskyi, who as the German-allied 'Hetman', holds incredible powers of both civil and military affairs. By 1927, German involvement in the Austrian Ausgleich negotiations meant that Ukraine fell de-facto into the hands of the Hetman, with King Vasily becoming an increasingly marginalised figure. Ukraine under the Hetmanate has become the breadbasket of the Reichspakt, and made its wealthy landowners exorbinantly wealthy, but at the expense of the Ukrainian peasantry. Now, almost twenty years after the Weltkrieg the national situation is unstable. The Reich forces us to sell our goods almost exclusively to nations within its sphere of influence while Socialists gain popularity amongst the downtrodden rural poor and city workers with each passing day. Both ethnic Russians and the pro-Russian population dream of unification with our former master to the East while Ukrainian nationalists proclaim that our Kingdom is no more than a German puppet. This is a immutable truth. Despite these many issues afflicting us, our land is prosperous and fertile, our people industrious and our potential boundless."
ukraine.1.a:0 "Shche Ne Vmerla Ukraina!"
ukraine.2.t:0 "The Ukrainian Government"
ukraine.2.d:0 "It is fair to say that our government is divided. While Pavlo Skoropadskyi does his best to solve the antagonism between the army, consisting of former officers of the Russian Imperial Army, and the civil administration, most of which actively supports our current position in the Reichspakt, many of Ukraine's problems can only be solved when the majority of our population - the kulaks and peasants - have an opportunity to sell their substantial agricultural produce in Europe beyond the narrow confines of the Reichspakt."
ukraine.2.a:0 "We shouldn't provoke the peasants!"
ukraine.3.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Ukraine!"
ukraine.3.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into the abyss, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now that the crash's shock waves have reached the Ukraine, German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ukrainian Hrivna is losing value, and resource exports are shrinking exponentially."
ukraine.3.a:0 "Let us hope that Europe remains open to us."
ukraine.4.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis!"
ukraine.4.d:0 "Since the Weltkrieg, Ukraine has traditionally relied upon its valuable grain trade with the German Empire in order to maintain its economic security. Unfortunately the current socio-economic issues afflicting the Reich have meant that it is now far more interested in protecting its own farmers than taking the politically unpopular move of subsidising Ukrainian agriculture. This could be very dangerous for us as without support from the German market, our ruling class of agrarian landowners could find it difficult to maintain their dominance in the countryside."
ukraine.4.a:0 "We're still the breadbasket of Europe, right?"
ukraine.5.t:0 "Faith and Nation"
ukraine.5.d:0 "Before the agricultural crisis pro-Russian movements were rather weak and disunited, ensuring they didn't pose much of a threat to our government. This crisis has led to a shocking rise in popular support for these organisations and an increase in their willingness to cooperate. Yesterday a famous Russian writer from Kiev, Mykhailo Bulhakov, proclaimed the unification of the three largest movements into a singular organisation known as 'Faith and Nation' ('Vera i Narod') or just 'ViN'. Supported by the Ukrainian Church, itself heavily influenced by the Moscow Patriarchate, the population of Southern and Eastern Ukraine and many high-ranking officers, this movement could provoke serious instability in some parts of our country."

He now claims that our silence on the crisis has exposed the weakness of our government, and that's why Ukraine should be ruled by 'real Ukrainian patriots'. His slogan 'Ukraine for the Ukrainians' is attractive to many citizens, especially in Western Ukraine, and graffiti has been spotted in a number of towns. This could be dangerous for the cabinet, since we've already lost considerable support in the East."

ukraine.8.t:0 "Khrushchev criticises the Ukrainian government."
ukraine.8.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev, a prominent Ukrainian social democrat, has opened the 3rd Congress of the Ukrainian Syndicalist Party. He demands that the government takes extreme measures to defend the workers and peasants from poverty brought on by the global crash. To further this agenda he has proposed a new programme of major social and economic reforms aimed at helping Ukraine overcome the crisis. The controversial figure is going to present his plan in the Rada soon."

ukraine.9.d:0 "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered the Ukrainian economy and the stability of many of the nation's most important institutions. The King's grip on the country is weakening by the hour, peasants loyal to the Hetman want major land reform, pro-Russian malcontents and Ukrainian nationalists demand radical measures and the Socialists are mobilising workers all over the country. Various political movements struggle for power in our teetering nation, and soon we have to choose who will lead Ukraine into the future."

ukraine.10.t:0 "Khrushchev's Speech"
ukraine.10.d:0 "As one of the few social democrats in the Rada, Nikita Khrushchev wields an mesmerising degree of influence over the Ukrainian peasantry and urban rabble. He has taken advantage of our troubles in a recent speech, where he has openly called for sweeping land reforms, an extension of the electoral franchise and an end to landlord dominance in the countryside. These demands are extremely popular among the lower classes, and are giving them ideas dangerous to national stability. Despite this, perhaps we could make use of Khrushchev's popularity and allow him to become the face of economic reforms unpopular amongst the rural landlords that we would otherwise take a political hit over anyway."

ukraine.11.t:0 "The Language Issue"
ukraine.11.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev has joined the government as leader during one of the darkest periods in our nation's history since 1918. However, before solving the economic problems it is imperative that Khrushchev respond to the burgeoning pro-Russian movement, which has had a malign impact on our electorate in industrial Ukraine. One method that could help neutralise their popularity is by addressing the language question, a domestic dilemma that has been lingering for years. The Russian language is used de-facto by a substantial percentage of the population, however its usage is expressly prohibited in state institutions. This has given rise to accusations that Russians are treated as second-class citizens."
ukraine.11.a:0 "Make Russian the second official state language."

ukraine.12.t:0 "National-Socialists Protest!"

Many have sought temporary exile in Romania and Russia, with both nations somewhat hostile to our pro-German regime and aware of the Kaiser's gaze turning west. Mykhailo Bulhakov has announced publicly that the nationalist umbrella organisation 'Faith and Nation' is ready to fight for the rights of Russians in Ukraine. Maybe we have made a big mistake."

ukraine.14.t:0 "Profits From Increased Taxation on the Kulaks"
ukraine.14.d:0 "Our decision to raise taxes on the Kulak landlords and spend this money on the poorest peasants has helped to stabilise our agriculture sector. 60-70% of the state and private farms are estimated to now be entirely self-supporting. As a result of our increased support from the villages and farms we can turn to other pressing issues with our faltering economy."
ukraine.14.a:0 "That's one fire extinguished."
ukraine.15.t:0 "Another Crisis!"
ukraine.15.d:0 "Our government's decision to divide the property of the Kulaks has led to a second crisis among the farmers. Our collectivisation attempts have ended in a total failure, with agricultural yields from the new collectivised farms cumulatively less than the smallholdings that they replaced. Unbelievably the situation in Ukraine has managed to deteriorate even further!"

This virtual erasure of eye-watering tarrifs and customs duties at the border would be a substantial boon for our own merchants and industrialists.

One of our major Reichspakt allies and the bastion of our Ostwall against a Russian resurgence, Ukraine's situation is already incredibly unstable, in part due to our protectionist measures during Black Week that proved detrimental to Ukrainian agriculture."

Doing so could be extremely unwise however as Ukraine possesses one of the largest armed forces in Europe and they are critical for our long-term plans as a bulwark against a belligerent Russia. Members of the Abwehr have instead suggested that we ought to use our ties with many senior Ukrainian army officials to instigate a reactionary coup d'etat in Kiev.

Since then, the government has failed to interfere with the poor administration of the factory, fearing their actions accidentally sparking a worker's revolt in Kiev. After the triumph of Syndicalism in Ukraine however, the French Commune has decided to help us with the revival of the factory. 'Arsenal' will mainly produce artillery, anti-tank, and anti-aircraft guns, all of which our nation, surrounded by forces hostile to our revolutionary ideology, desperately need."

After a number of street battles and open warfare raging in government buildings, the putschists began purging Reds wherever they could find them. A nervous King Vasily was given sweeping powers by a pliant Rada and again signed Ukraine up as a formal member of the Reichspakt.

According to this proposed programme by integrating privately owned landholdings into state run collectively-controlled farms, a greater crop yield can be achieved.

Despite the conflicting views held by the factions they remain a united force primarily thanks to Khrushchev, whose cult like following amongst the peasantry has allowed himself and his allies to coerce the moderates into remaining loyal. For now Khrushchev has held back on previous radical promises such as the abolishment of the monarchy in order to appease the social democratic majority who wish for progressive change, his increasingly vague stances have helped maintain the Front’s unity whilst not completely rejecting the will of his hardcore supporters. The social-democratic majority also serves as a tool used by Khrushchev to appeal to Vasyl who would surely oppose co-operation had the vanguardists been given a larger platform."

Thanks to Comrade Khruschev the Ukranian state is rapidly industrialising and modernising.

After the shocking death of the king who brought democracy to our nation, Syndicalists have been rounded up and banned from government in an effort to prevent those responsible from taking control in the next election. Meanwhile, the Nationalists have more or less become a fringe party and early polls are showing they will likely not reach the threshold to be on the ballot in the next election. Furthermore, reports coming out of Ukrainian newspapers discovered a plot by Pavlo Skoropadskyi to undermine Ukrainian democracy by dissolving the Rada had they received a majority in the previous election and as such have been banned from future elections."

Protests have been mounting in Kyiv in recent days to implement moderate reforms based on the model of Western democracies such as those found in Scandinavia, stopping short of a total governmental overhaul but instead calling for open elections to solve the deadlock in the Rada. While a minority of these protesters are ardent republicans, many seem open to the idea of retaining Vasyl as a constitutional monarch. One of Ukraine's most prominent generals, Symon Petliura, has expressed their support for the protests, saying that allowing free elections to the Rada could go a long way to bridge the gap between left and right, and perhaps even solve the ongoing agricultural crisis."

Long preferring to walk alone without his usual accompaniment of guards, the fact something like this did not happen early is a bit shocking. The assassin, apprehended as soon as the shots were heard, was a member of the banned Communist Party of Ukraine, led by one Nikita Khrushchev, long an opponent of our regime. Despite this, the King's death could not come at a more opportune time. Although supportive of our reforms, the King had yet to fully embrace the rebirth of the revolution. With his death, Leo Stefan von Habsburg, not yet even a teenager, has been chosen by our government to replace the late King. Due to him still having years before he can fully take on his responsibilities, Leo Stefan, now King Lev II, is a perfect match, as he can be shown the truths of our ideals and policies.

Each and every man was convicted of treason, with the rope waiting for Khrushchev and others. What's more, the KMS has been formally banned, it's assets seized and turned over to the People's Government.

Seeing as how we both find ourselves adrift in a sea of hostile ideologies, it has been agreed that both of our parties should merge, allowing us to implement our programs all the easier. Mykhailo Yalovy, our foreign minister, is a personal friend of Shumskyi, thus making the merger all the easier.\n\nThis merger is, of course, not just for convenience, it also allows us to keep a closer eye on Shumskyi, as he is seen as a threat to our rule.

Bohdan Khmelnytskyi is one such man. Fighting against the oppressive rule of the Poles, Khmelnytskyi's might established a free nation that we are the inheritors of such. In emulation of his legacy, and the government's own promotion of men such like him, various militias of peasants have formed, and have begun attacking and seizing land from Polish nobles that inhabit the west of our country. While these raids have been fairly tame, it cannot be said they don't show what a rallied up people can do. Within the sized lands, the former palaces of the landowning Poles have been transformed into massive schools, greatly increasing education within our rural population. What's more, the land sized has actually been handed over to government control by the people, giving us the chance to see it divided up correctly. With more raids planned or ongoing, it seems the people have finally found an outlet for years of oppression."

While both have waited for a moment of weakness, waiting for us to slip up so they could size Bessarabia out from under us. It seems however, that this period of relative peace has ended. Over the course of the past few days, a string of terror attacks, carried out by what appears to be a contingent of Cossacks fighting what they claim is a 'modern day Yasir for the Ukrainian population in Bessarabia.'\n\nWhile we have no evidence besides hearsay, it is believed these Cossacks are agents of the 'Monarcho-Socialist' government in Kiev. Seemingly confirming this, Kiev has offered to subdue these terrorists, in exchange for 'temporary authority' over Bessarabia. In other words, they are demanding we hand over Bessarabia or the attacks will continue, if not all out war between our two nations. While such a war would no doubt be easily won, many within our government are calling for us to cave to Ukraine and to focus on reclaiming the rest of Greater Romania, saying we can always get the land back later. Whatever our choice, we must do something quickly, before even more lives are lost. "
monsocukr.7.a:0 "It will take more then terrorists for us to hand over our land!"
monsocukr.7.b:0 "Enough! The Ukrainians can have the land, it's not worth the human toll."

monsocukr.8.t:0 "Failure of Operation Muromets"
monsocukr.8.d:0 "Despite our best attempts, our convert efforts to get Romanian to hand over Bessarabia peacefully, also known as Operation Muromets, has failed. Despite having no direct evidence to link our government to the various terrorist attacks and cells that formed as a result of our actions, the Romanian government clearly seems to know it was us, and has issued a stern 'warning' that any attempts to restore order within Bessarabia by our troops would be seen as an act of war. While the Operation was clearly a failure, that doesn't mean we can't capitalize on the chaos that reigns in Bessarabia to quickly seize it from Romania will a small war. Regardless, the operation was a failure, and the only remaining avenue to capture the land is by war, if that war comes sooner or later remains to be seen however."
monsocukr.8.a:0 "Death to Romania! We march for Greater Ukraine!"
monsocukr.8.b:0 "They've won this round, we'll be back..."

monsocukr.9.t:0 "An Offer from the South"
monsocukr.9.d:0 "Much like ourselves, the government of Ukraine has recently taken a great leap forward, emerging as a predominant People's Government under the watchful eye of their King. Just like us, they have fallen adrift in a sea of conflicting ideologies and movements, however unlike when we first took up the mantle of the King and the People, a grouping of like minded nations exists, that of course being us and our Union of People's Crowns. Seeking to latch onto a nation that shares ideals, the Ukrainian Government has formally petitioned to join the Union of People's Crowns. Promising access to their vast grain resources, the Ukrainian delegation has promised that there is nothing to lose by granting them membership in the Union. Despite this, many wonder if they have alternative motives in this request, thus bringing their motivation for  joining into question."
monsocukr.9.a:0 "Of course! Long live the People's Crowns!"
monsocukr.9.b:0 "What has Ukraine ever done for us? Rejected!"

monsocukr.10.t:0 "A Disappointing Response"
monsocukr.10.d:0 "Much to our disappointment, the People's Government of White Ruthenia has denined our request to join the Union of People's Crowns. While unexpected, this is expected to have little effect on the nation overall. Despite this, we once again find ourselves alone, with our backs to the wall. May God protect the Union, for we cannot."
monsocukr.10.a:0 "A setback for sure, but one we can recover from."

monsocukr.11.t:0 "The East Ablaze" 
monsocukr.11.d:0 "As predicted, the Russians and Russophiles who inhabit the east of our nation have not taken kindly to our efforts to remove their perfidious influence. What started as a series of spontaneous protests against our anti-russian policies has turned into riots, and in the worst case, all out insurgency. While this violence has no chance of succeeding in anything more then property damage,  it is a sign of just how deep the Bear was able to sink it's claws into our nation. The armed forces are already preparing a plan to pacify the East; Those who rebel will be given two choices, return home and accept the righteous of the King and the People's Government, or be driven to Russia, where they can finally be united with the 'Motherland'. Those who resist even this most generous offer will face our full wrath, knowing what it means to face the People's justice. Either way, by the time we are done, Ukraine shall finally be free of the Russian Bear, after so long a time."
monsocukr.11.a:0 "Resistance is futile."
