crete_sale.1.t:0 "The Cretan Question"
crete_sale.1.d:0 "With our economy in shambles after Black Monday, our Colonial Empire has been under fairly harsh scrutiny. The main territory that has been under examination is Crete. Crete is larger and harder to defend than Malta, and the upkeep is higher as well. To help with our deficit, it has been proposed that we essentially sell the island to either the Ottomans or the Greeks. What shall we do?"
crete_sale.1.a:0 "Keep Crete under our influence."
crete_sale.1.b:0 "Offer Crete to the Ottomans."
crete_sale.1.c:0 "Offer Crete to the Greeks."

crete_sale.2.t:0 "The Sale of Crete"
crete_sale.2.d:0 "The Germans have come offering the sale of Crete. While it would obviously cost us a sizeable amount of money, having the island once more would greatly strengthen our position in the Mediterranean. What shall our reply be?"
crete_sale.2.a:0 "Welcome home, Crete!"
crete_sale.2.b:0 "We do not need that rock."

crete_sale.3.t:0 "The Sale of Crete"
crete_sale.3.d:0 "The Ottoman Ambassador has sent a message to us, declaring that the Sultan has agreed to buy Crete. We have begun to transfer control of the Cretan State to them."
crete_sale.3.a:0 "Great."

crete_sale.4.t:0 "The Ottomans don't want Crete"
crete_sale.4.d:0 "The Ottomans have replied to our offer, flatly stating that they do not want Crete. What shall we do?"
crete_sale.4.a:0 "Keep Crete under our influence then."
crete_sale.4.b:0 "Offer it to Greece."

crete_sale.5.t:0 "The Sale of Crete"
crete_sale.5.d:0 "The Germans have come offering the sale of Crete. While it would obviously cost us a sizeable amount of money, having the island once more would greatly strengthen our position in the Mediterranean. What shall our reply be?"

crete_sale.6.t:0 "The Sale of Crete"
crete_sale.6.d:0 "The Greek Ambassador has sent a message to us, declaring that the Greek King has agreed to buy Crete. We have begun to transfer control of the Cretan State to them."
crete_sale.6.a:0 "Great!"

crete_sale.7.b:0 "Offer it to the Ottoman Empire."

crete_sale.8.t:0 "The Cretan State"
crete_sale.8.d:0 "With the transaction finalised with the Germans, the status of the Cretan state has come to the forefront of our agenda. As the Cretan State was originally created because of our weak grasp on the island, the majority of the ministers are pushing to just shuffling the government in Crete. However a few hawkish men are calling for direct annexation. What shall we do?"
crete_sale.8.a:0 "Install a new Cretan government."
crete_sale.8.b:0 "End its autonomy!"

crete_sale.9.t:0 "The Cretan State"
crete_sale.9.d:0 "With the transaction finalised with the Germans, the status of the Cretan state has come to the forefront of our agenda. As Crete was ours before we lost the Weltkrieg, the majority of the ministers are pushing to annex the Cretan state. However, a few men are calling for only an indirect subordination of Crete. What shall we do?"
crete_sale.9.a:0 "Install a new Cretan government."
crete_sale.9.b:0 "Hurrah for the second Enosis!"

crete_sale.10.t:0 "The Second Weltkrieg!"
crete_sale.10.d:0 "The Germans and French are once more at war! While we have duly joined the war against the Syndicalists, the 'Enosis' brotherhood have been gathering strength..."
crete_sale.10.a:0 "Good riddance!"
crete_sale.10.b:0 "The Enosis brotherhood coups the government!"

crete_sale.11.t:0 "Crete is Greek once more!"
crete_sale.11.d:0 "With the Germans embroiled in their war with the Syndicalists, our brothers in Crete took the chance to rise against the Germans!"
crete_sale.11.a:0 "Hurrah for the second Enosis!"
