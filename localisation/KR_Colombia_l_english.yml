### Ideas ###
COL_factionalized_army:0 "Factionalized Army"
COL_factionalized_army_desc:0 "Since the war with Peru, Colombia’s armed forces have become strongly divided politically. While the a few top generals are orbiting around Field Marshal Pinilla, others feel like the Caudillo should didn't diserve his post, that previously was occupied by much more respected war heroes, and they instead support the ex-conservative Gomez Castro and his christian message, meanwhile many of the privates and lower ranking officers are in favour of a more hands-off approach or even openly oppose their superiors. As a whole, the military apparatus is unconvinced about the competence and leadership of Pinilla. He has much to prove, and many consider the Marshal incapable of leading a stabilized Colombia. This attitude is reflected in the general state of our army, which is greatly disorganized and unprepared for battle."
COL_licenses_from_GER:0 "Ties with Germany"
COL_licenses_from_GER_desc:0 "Field Marshal Pinilla has successfully petitioned for the support of the German Empire. After a successful meeting with the Kaiser's diplomats, new economic and military agreements have been set in stone between our two nations, and German companies and weapon licenses have begun to be contracted within our nation's factories. With the support of the world's finest fighting force, our military's capabilities have grown extensively."
COL_licenses_from_GER_weapons:0 "Ties with Germany"
COL_licenses_from_GER_weapons_desc:0 "Field Marshal Pinilla has successfully petitioned for the support of the German Empire. After a successful meeting with the Kaiser's diplomats, new economic and military agreements have been set in stone between our two nations, and German companies and weapon licenses have begun to be contracted within our nation's factories. With the support of the world's finest fighting force, our military's capabilities have grown extensively."
COL_licenses_from_GER_motors:0 "Ties with Germany"
COL_licenses_from_GER_motors_desc:0 "Field Marshal Pinilla has successfully petitioned for the support of the German Empire. After a successful meeting with the Kaiser's diplomats, new economic and military agreements have been set in stone between our two nations, and German companies and weapon licenses have begun to be contracted within our nation's factories. With the support of the world's finest fighting force, our military's capabilities have grown extensively."
COL_licenses_from_GER_both:0 "Ties with Germany"
COL_licenses_from_GER_both_desc:0 "Field Marshal Pinilla has successfully petitioned for the support of the German Empire. After a successful meeting with the Kaiser's diplomats, new economic and military agreements have been set in stone between our two nations, and German companies and weapon licenses have begun to be contracted within our nation's factories. With the support of the world's finest fighting force, our military's capabilities have grown extensively."
COL_tradecongress:0 "Congreso de Sindicatos Colombianos"
COL_tradecongress_desc:0 "A congress of the nation’s trade unions has been established and called the 'Congress of Colombian Syndicates'. The governing body was inspired by European syndicalist countries like the Commune of France and the Union of Britain. While the European model of Syndicalism may not fit our economic capabilities, it seems to be successful so far. Our people are enjoying the fruits of a new political freedom, and this morale boost is helping us establish our new economic system and is slightly boosting our industrial output."
COL_armedminorities:0 "Armed Minorities"
COL_armedminorities_desc:0 "All Colombian peoples have a right to preserve their own dignity. Indigenous people and Afro-Colombians, among other minorities, often had to struggle to survive under the yoke of capitalism. Many times their livelihoods were destroyed in the name of 'profit'. Now the time has come to let their voices be heard and help us build a new society based on equality and participation by having the various formerly oppressed minority groups join our armed forces in order to help us defend their rights. We are not a nation of one people, and this fact makes us stronger."

COL_antisocialist_trade_idea:0 "Anti-Socialist Trade"
COL_antisocialist_trade_idea_1:0 "Well Oiled Political Machine"
COL_socialisteconomy_desc:0 "As part of our new benevolent rule, a new economic system is put in place, as it has already been done in other parts of the world. The end goal is for the means of production to be held by the workers, but at the moment the effort is concentrated primarily on securing economic independence from foreign capital, which has proven difficult because of the capitalistic pigs in our vicinities. This radical shift will prove to be difficult to implement, but Colombia has previously shown that it is ready to deal with difficult situations such as this. It is only a matter of time before the growing pains subside."
COL_industrialist_protest:0 "Industrialists Protest"
COL_industrialist_protest_desc:0 "Remnants of the Old Colombia still resist our rightful rule. The industrialists are protesting the implementation of new measures proposed by the Revolutionary Congress to empower labor unions and redistribute wealth. This is having terrible effects on our economy, as factories are closing en masse in a misguided attempt to stop the socialist forces or at least to force concessions from them. We must act before the masses of unemployed turn on us in an unjust rage."
COL_industrialist_protest_crushed:0 "Industrialists Protest Crushed"
COL_industrialist_protest_crushed_desc:0 "The worst has come to an end. The industrialists protested the implementation of new measures proposed by the Revolutionary Congress to empower labor unions and redistribute wealth, closing factories and shops en masse in attempt to stop the socialist forces or at least to force concessions from them. The governament has responded rapidly and with force, dispersing the crowd and forcing the strikers to reopen their workplaces, one way of another."
COL_helping_the_darien:0 "Helping the Darien"
COL_helping_the_darien_desc:0 "The Darien, once Department of Chocó, was one if not the first spanish settlement in Colombia. Since then, because of the large abundance of inhospitable forest and swamps, the region developed much less and at a slower pace than the rest of the country. We have granted The Darien provisory independence under collaborationist Leopardos government and promised them help to their economy in order to catch up with us."
COL_exiling_enemies:0 "Casting Out The Enemy"
COL_exiling_enemies_desc:0 "Colombia cannot become a world power if the socialists and their allies keep getting in the way. Thankfully, Arango Ramos has come up with a plan to exile our opposition without causing an international scandal by setting up a puppet state in Chocó administered by him..."
COL_exiling_enemies_heavy:0 "Mass Exiling"
COL_exiling_enemies_heavy_desc:0 "Colombia cannot become a world power if the socialists and their allies keep getting in the way. Thankfully Arango Ramos has come up with a plan to exile our opposition immediately by setting up a puppet state in Chocó to keep the most troublesome citizens under careful watch. He'll figure out what to do with them..."
COL_political_turmoil:0 "Political Turmoil"
COL_political_turmoil_desc:0 "In a country where the two party system has always been the norm, the recent birth of minor parties led by ex-members of the Liberal and Conservative parties has moved the country’s political discourse to the extremes. Frequent episodes of violence have emerged in all of Colombia, especially in the zones furthest from the capital, where the state's grip is weakest. Many political analysts predict that at this rate we will have serious trouble to deal with in the next few years, and politically-motivated violence may become the norm."
COL_black:0 "Black Monday"
COL_black_desc:0 "Black Monday had a very harsh effect on Colombia's economy, with a large part of the population suddenly becoming jobless and losing their livelihood as companies folded almost overnight. Massive changes will be necessary to stop this economic disaster and put the country back on its feet!"
COL_black_2:0 "Recovering from Black Monday"
COL_black_2_desc:0 "The first signs of a recovery are starting to appear as Colombia's economy seems to be turning a corner, but there is still much more work to be done if we wish to boast that we have beaten this crisis."
COL_black_over:0 "¡Adios Black Monday!"
COL_black_over_desc:0 "Finally the era of Black Monday has become a thing of the past. No one will miss these hard times and Colombia is celebrating her victory against the grim fate that at first seemed inevitable. Business seems to be returning to pre-crisis levels, and people are celebrating and chanting in the streets: 'Adios Black Monday, may you never come back'."
COL_bogotazo:0 "¡El Bogotazo!"
COL_bogotazo_desc:0 "As many analysts previously correctly predicted, a spark was all it took to ignite serious riots and the nation has delved into chaos. Now, armed political groups are openly fighting in the streets and setting fire to buildings and vehicles."
COL_bogotazo_2:0 "¡El Bogotazo!"
COL_bogotazo_2_desc:0 "As many analysts previously correctly predicted, a spark was all it took to ignite serious riots and the nation has delved into chaos. Now, armed political groups are openly fighting in the streets and setting fire to buildings and vehicles."

COL_worse_bogotazo:0 "¡El Bogotazo!"
COL_worse_bogotazo_desc:0 "In the awful climate of violence and destruction perpetrated by both sides of the political spectrum, the president decided to take sides and in doing so has only made the problem worse. Even if not yet declared, Colombia is now on the verge of a civil war."

COL_new_constructions:0 "Building Up the Public Transport Network"
COL_new_constructions_desc:0 "Fulfilling promises to develop the capital's public infrastructure, a new public transport system is being built in Bogotá. As a result of the massive public works project being undertaken, a large portion of government funding and resources that could’ve been used elsewhere are being diverted to bring reliable public transport to the people of Bogotá."
COL_religious_schools:0 "Religious Schools"
COL_religious_schools_desc:0 "Childrens in public schools are taught extensively about the ways of Christ and his message, but much less about history, algebra and other relevant skills for more technical careers. The next generation's preparation for the modern job market is suffering because of this and the nation now lacks good engineers and scientists, but on the bright side we've no shortage of priests."
COL_reform_mil_academies:0 "Reformed Military Academies"
COL_reform_mil_academies_desc:0 "As Field Marshal Pinilla and other high ranking army leaders demanded, the reformation of military academies is intended to assure the loyalty of the cadets and eliminate any risk of having soldiers secretly siding with the socialists and other insurgent elements. This of course will increase the amount of time needed to train new recruits as we ensure their loyalty to the cause, but won’t really provide much in terms of extra combat readiness for our troops."
COL_airdisaster:0 "President in Hospital"
COL_airdisaster_desc:0 "The President had an accident during an Air Show in Bogotá and he is now being kept under close observation in a hospital. A Temporary Council lead by one appointee chosen by the Congress has been formed to substitute him since the vice-presidency has been abolished by the 1910 constitutional reforms. Although the Council is trying their best to keep the public morale up and the cities safe in this difficult moment, many are seizing the opportunity to protest the legitimacy of the government and its recent policies."

Estimates of the number of deaths ranged from 47 to as high as 2000. Public outcry ensued and a then-fringe faction lead by Jorge Eliécer Gaitán managed to swing the congress into adopting extensive measures to limit the power of the armed forces and punishing those responsible for the 'Bananeras Massacre'.\nHaving lost support in the congress the conservatives ceded power to the liberals who formed a government in 1930.\n\nJust two years later a dispute over territory in the Amazon rainforest and control of the economically strategic Rio Putumayo caused a regional conflict between our forces and Peruvian troops which escalated into a formal war. International support soon backed each side while the Conservative Party staunchly opposed the government's diplomatic effort. An emergency military junta was quickly formed to lead the country throu war.\nThe war lasted one and a half years before a miscalculated intervention by Ecuador, who were given a provocatory ultimatum by Peru, opened a new frontline in Guayaquil and the surrounding areas.\nBecause of the disastrous state of the army due to the extensive reforms following the 'Bananeras Massacre' scandal, Peru was able to swiftly conquer the rest of Ecuadorian territories and could push directly into our heartland.\nThe following treaty was humiliating as we lost a large portion of its southern lands.\n\nOnce again, the army fell out of favor and a large majority of the colombian people, dissatisfied with the poor handeling of the war crisis by both historical party demanded changes in the goverment.\nThe socialist formed UNIR, a coalition of all socialist parties, while moderate liberals and nationalists orchestrated the birth of a new party, APEN, essentially centrist in nature but that could function as a catch-all party.

More and more people are starting to lose faith in the democratic system and resorting to the long established colombian tradition of turning against in rage. Many supporters of the two old parties, the Liberal and the Conservative, have launched attacks on the publications supporting the opposing side. Others were caught throwing rocks at our local headquarters, many buildings were set on fire and there have been a severe increase of murders expecially against our supporters, that were suprised by their assassins while at work, at church or even in their own homes. This new wave of violence is currently confined to the coastal cities, but soon it could spread to our capital and other major urban centers in the interior. Meanwhile, although the army has been deployed to maintain order, certain elements within the army are also fanning the flames of hate against UNIR voters. People's militias are starting to organize in the Meta and Chocó department, where the government’s control is weakest, proclaiming their need for self-defence. Some of them are even calling for a nationwide revolution, which could result in a large-scale civil war.\n\nThe situation is getting increasingly desperate with every hour that passes. No less desperate is the state of our army, which is underequipped and filled with subversive elements. Should we trust Field Marshal Pinilla and his men or should we, rather, maintain our diplomatic attitude?\nActually... there could be another solution.

Buses have been set on fire, shops looted and destroyed, and police vehicles stolen. Chaos has sunk its claws deep into our nation. News of the attempt has spread to the more rural areas of our nation where the violence was just as serious as it was in the cities.

Approximately a hundred thousand participants are participating alongside the organizers, utilizing absolute silence from all of the demonstrators to denounce the recent episodes of violence that have shaken the country. Gaitán has used the march to call for an end to the government’s use of the police and military forces to repress political opposition and invites us to confront the issue in a more civil and constitutional manner. As boots unceremoniously meet the cobbled roads of the city, there is no chanting or screaming, only silence. Although today’s protest has thus far proceeded without incident, another protest is already scheduled for next Sunday in Manizales, with another in Villavicencio in the works.\n\nIronically, on the other side of Colombia, the same people advocating for a peaceful solution to our country’s problems defile it with violence and brutality. The militias run amok in the countryside. Our administration hears nothing but horror stories from those who cross paths with these brigands - tales of looting, pillaging, and absolute savagery are widespread. Masked raiders sack and loot local businesses and properties to buy equipment and ammunition and then use those to loot some more, thus repeting the vicious cycle. One man even tells his own savage tale of the socialist's brutality: upon being captured and his conservative ideals being revealed, the militia used him to bait his family into emerging from their hiding spots around the surrounding property. Upon capturing the entire family, the man was forced to watch as soldiers asked his brother if he wanted to 'race' or be shot. Not knowing what that meant exactly the man chose the former and four soldiers simultaneously held him down, doused him with fuel, and set him ablaze, watching carefully as he fled down the street eventually falling down a cliff. While the survivor looked on in abject terror, these terrorists laughed while others grumbled, upset at their lost bet.\n\nDespite the current peaceful veneer Gaitán is trying to lend the protests, officials in the army are asking us to end this charade, fearing that the country's security might continue to slip if these socialists keep propagandize their fanatical message. Should we grant the army authorization to utilize force to disperse the protestors if they don’t comply with orders?"

That was, however, until the assassination attempt on Socialist firebrand Jorge Eliécer Gaitán - an enemy of our democracy, but beloved by a small, fanatic minority within our electoral base. It seems some of our Cachiporros did not get the memo to not throw in with the socialists of Gaitán - the greater of two evils - over the Chulavitas, that as just as bad but that are not at this moment our primary objective, for that hitting them helps the 'comrades' more then it helps our democracy. What can we expects from the illiterate farmers who largely comprise our more radical base? They cannot understand that our political landscape has shifted, that Gaitán is not their 'friend' anymore, if ever he was; that he is just interested in making his dream of a totalitarian state. Regardless, some Cachiporros loyal to his image have spiraled out of control and into mayhem as they take justice and retribution into their own hands; these kind of violent episodes have come to a gruesome head in the city of Bucaramanga.\n\nA known conservative stronghold, Bucaramanga is a central base of operations for the Chulavitas - a fact our Cachiporros know all too well. Marching into Santander's biggest city with machetes and rifles drawn, our Cachiporros began to mercilessly cut down any random citizen - both militant and civilian - that crossed their path in brutal fashion. With a hack off a limb here and a shot through the head there, our bloodthirsty troops ravaged the 'starred city' like a pack of wild, savage beasts. The situation only escalated when police forces were brought in, who began to indiscriminately fire upon all suspects, with more innocents tragically being gunned down in the crossfire. In the initial scuffle between their forces, two policemen were shot dead, and taking advantage of the brief lapse in enemy fire, some of our forces fled to a nearby ranch to hide out. However, when they arrived, they found the ranch occupied by the family who worked it, and instead of simply letting them go, our paramilitary troops made the situation even worse by taking the married couple and their four children hostage."

Though it is currently unknown if the police were aware the Cachiporros had hostages with them in the farmhouse, they were well aware the paramilitary forces were using it as a hideout, and without hesitation, the police commander ordered every one of his officers to fire upon the building. In a cacophony of splintering wood, singed materials from the heat of gun brass, and with crimson blood flying through the air, the lives of all inside - both combatant and hostage - were erased in one violent instant. \n\nAs tragic of an incident as this 'Massacre of Bucaramanga' has become, the reverberations it has caused are of an even greater magnitude. People across the nation are demanding an explanation as to how so many innocent lives were so callously thrown away. Our former-allies among the Conservatives and Liberals - who once tolerated our moderated syncretic approach to politics as an alternative to the Pumarejo camp - now call for our resignation, turning their backs on those who aided them in their time of need. Even our armed forces are enraged over the incident, shaming us for using unproven and wild paramilitaries instead of just simply calling in the national military. \n\nWith so many of our former allies and supporters now putting up obstacles and standing before us as foes, our administration’s hands are tied, and we are left with two options. We can either attempt to diplomatically approach this mess, reaching out to the army, and to Laureano Gómez Castro in order to keep the peace, or we can simply deny all responsibility and blame the whole thing on independently acting paramilitary commanders.

They demanded for the newspaper to print a list of their proposed solutions to our country's problems for the whole of Colombia and even the world to see, unless the government responds to their ultimatum. The text opens with an accusation of ineptitude by our government, due to our inability to settle the situation still ongoing in Antioquia, which they say would 'easily be resolved' by simply accepting the demands of strikers and by answering their plea for improved working conditions. What follows is a long list of claims and grievances separated by demands coming from each faction. Chief among the claims are the Totalist's request to arm the party for self defense and the Syndicalist's request to instruct our foreign affairs with the goal of forming a closer bond with the Commune of France and all other member of the Internationale Congress.

Later, we received a written and signed copy of their ultimatum. It details the demands for the establishment of a special military Emergency Force designated exclusively to deal with the socialist threat, the reformation of military academies in order to assure discipline and moral rigor within their ranks and the nomination of Carlos Cortes Vargas as a candidate.\nThis last point is maybe the most concerning one, since Vargas became infamous for his leading role in the Bananeras Massacre.

So far, total number of casualties alludes us as the authorities are still investigating the area and excavating the rubble for more bodies. However, news of this travesty has already spread like wildfire, and it has thrown many people in the cities into almost mass hysteria out of fear of yet another attack. This event has definitely stirred our political scene to a breaking point, with many officials somehow pointing blame at us, having so poorly managed the situation that it had escalated to this. Furthermore, the police have yet to arrest any suspects involved. Therefore, it seems that the perpetrators of this heinous crime will get away unscathed. Many members of our party are now calling for emergency elections, which may work in our favour if we announce it on the 20th of July - our Independence Day - in order to reassure that it won't be another fad.

Obviously, this statement has garnered much praise from both like-minded sympathizers and the afrocolombians themselves, and many have seen their confidence increase as a response to the afrocolombians now becoming even more active in the politics of the country.

col.41.d:0 "What in the beginning seemed like an improbable friendship between the Chulavitas and Leopardos, with an history of ideological tensions arosing from the Leopardos contrarian stance toward the almost theocratic religious views of Gomez, that at first they supported but later rejected entirely, most probably because of the desire of the populist group to differenciate their plan for the future of Colombia from that of the more popular authoritarian candidate, as some political commentators point out. But, with the ramping up of tensions and the acquired popularity of the left wing coalition lead by UNIR, it seems the two neo-conservative parties decided to find a common ground and run toghether at the next elections. They, along with some minor local parties, signed a pact today forming a coalition calling itself the Nationalist Bloc, which they define as the formation of a new conservative movement aimed at combating socialism, rediscussing race and purity, and bringing new job opportunities to the nation. A strong nationalist footprint pervades the document and it makes explicit mention of the intention to bring Colombia to the center stage geopolitically as they claim should already have been the case. Some army leaders, including Field Marshal Pinilla, also offered their congratulations to presidential candidate Laureano Gomez, promising their full support. As many are the things that accomunate the two parties there are also substancial differences that might obstaculate the realization of the project. Firstly there is the religious question, and while they both belive that Colombian people should think and act according to the principles espoused on the Bible, they don't agree on the role of the Christian Church into politics, if the state should become one with the Church or if religious men should only act as 'shepards for the people' as one of the Leopardos main ideologues recently wrote in one of his articles. Additionaly Gomez is seen as much more pragmatic then the others, and that is saying something seeing how he is often depicted as an hot headed person by Liberals and Conservatives alike."

He also stated to journalists that he and his people are willing to work to Gaitán and his coalition if they can assure him all points of this manifesto will be respected, which should not come as a surprise since Lame has a long history of working closesly with syndical activist many of whom are still active in one of the formations and some of whom are espected to be made ministers in the worrisome eventuality UNIR should actually win the election.

Although most of the topics brought forth were solved with little dispute, today the Revolutionary Congress have placed forth a far more controversial question - what will be Colombia's stance on foreign matters, and where will it stand on the international stage?\n\nFrom the first hours of the day there has been an hot debate between all three branches of our political union as they all have a different answer to this question, but as discussion went on ultimately the consensus came when a delegate argued that, with the imminent threat of a counter-revolution our foreign affairs discussion should instead focus on how to handle our neighbours. We took the floor first and addressed the need to focus on securing a future for our country in the immediate future instead of looking for more trouble outside our borders so we proposed to act aggressively if needed but in the meantime reassure our neighbors that our new revolution should be seen as a unicum in the Latin American region and that we will strictly keep to our own affairs. This would, we argued, preserve our nation unity and, in doing so, set an example of resilience for other Socialist nations to follow.\nThe PSC, in contrast, have thrown their support in with the Third Internationale, citing them as the 'biggest safety net against the imperialist rats', despite the fact they agree with the sentiment that the Commune of France has done little to support their South American brothers. They suggested that reassuring our neighbours shouldn't be a priority of a true revolutionary state and finally ended their argument with the famous Marx quote 'workers of the world, unite'.\nLastly, the Totalists proposed solution entails a plan to take our enemies unprepared and to mobilize before they have the chance to attack us, however [COL.GetColombianTotLeaderLastName] didn't make himself clear if in this case the Colombian Commune would be one thaking the initiative to attack our neighbours or if, simply, they propose a show of force in orded to deter them.

Soon our militiamen were in position, with the ends of their rifles glaring at every opening. Though there was no sign of Pinilla himself, our men waited patiently. As Gordillo arrived, he waited yet his host would never arrive.\n\nThe silence was broken as the screech of a bullet pierced the air - chaos erupted as the militiamen stormed into the house. Startled from the sudden uproar, it seemed that Gordillo had attempted to fire at one of the militiamen but was shot dead before he could pull the trigger. Further investigation found that the first shot was towards a figure that one of the men saw bolting from the back door, away into the wilderness. We can only conclude that it was Pinilla himself who managed to flee. That, and the fact that a sapphire-blue medal was discovered by the edges of the woods, cracked and chipped in its centre; it was the 'Orden de Boyacá', Pinilla's most prized possession.\n\nHe will most certainly never show his face around ever again, and as far as the rest of the nation is concerned, there was never a man by the name of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, or Gabriel París Gordillo."

The Chulavitas have told us of the brutal oppression that many peaceful protestors have faced in the last few days, which is not hard for us to believe considering the similar cases of socialists taking charge across the world in the recent past. They also tell us that many Colombian citizens are questioning the legitimacy of the election results. They, along with other nationalist parties, are begging us to intervene immediately by supporting autonomous militias in order to ensure order and the defence of Christian values that UNIR have desecrated. By doing this, the Chulavitas leader Laureano Gomez Castro assures us that the Colombian government will quickly fall, but we cannot rely on his word alone - many figures in our own government have spoken out against intervening, not wanting to risk outright war.

To the near North-West there is the Darien Jungle, near Panama, to the East there are large swath of abandoned land near our borders with Venezuela and of course the large Amazon Jungle, all the perfect areas to fund and train foreign militias far from indescreet eyes.\n\nEvaluating this opportunity, our Foreign Minister [scripted loc for minister name here] has concocted a plan to set up a private training zone open to all socialists volunteers from across the continent.

col.777.t:0 "Warning Signs"
col.777.d:0 "During the latest meeting of the ruling council of the main Leopardos some trouble arose. While Eliseo Arango and Jose Camancho Carreno spoke of their plans for the future which included fortifying the nations racial identity, championing anti-Imperialism and reshaping the armed forces, two other Leopardo idealogues, Augusto Ramierez Moreno and Joaquin Fidalgo Hermida stayed silent, sitting a corner smoking and paying little if any attention. When Arango addressed them and asked for their opinions they responded curtly, exchanged glances then returned to their previous routine of smoking and disinterest. The rest of the meeting went smoothly but at the end Villegas called Camancho aside and told him what was going on. Moreno and Hermida had attended a recent lecture given by philosopher Fernando Gonzalez Ochoa, a man known in Leopardos and outsiders circles, mainly for his views on Latin racial purity, complete state-church separation, esotericism, and for his love for Nietzsche and his theories. While to the average observer these views may seem not too different from our own, his goals differ a lot, as he considers nationalism and authoritarianism simply as a necessary mean to bring about a new age where every citizens is free from the state and lives according to his own personal principles, as he explained in many of his books and more recently in his self-published newspaper 'Antioquia'.\nIf we let Moreno and Hermida go they could rally more of these crypto-Oachian supporters to our cause or alienate the radicals and split the party. We must respond before things get out of hand."
col.777.a:0 "We shouldn't worry for now."

col.777.c:0 "It's enough to expel them!"
col.778.t:0 "Ignorance Isn’t Always Bliss"
col.778.d:0 "Augusto Moreno and Joaquin Hermida were once again quiet and all together disinterested during today's meeting, again; not speaking once during the entire event. At the end they spoke with each other and Villegas and, after a long discussion, resigned from the party. Moving quickly the Council has managed to talk to Villegas and has convinced him to revoke his resignation. However, that was only stemming the bleeding. Moreno and Hermida have already severed their ties with us."
col.778.a:0 "We don't need them"
col.779.t:0 "Reconciliation"
col.779.d:0 "At the next meeting we confronted Moreno and Hermida and, after a long and sometimes heated discussion, the pair were convinced to stay with us. They have agreed that leaving would split the party and leave us weaker than if we stay united. In return for their continued support we have agreed to adopt certain aspects of their new platform. This has left the more moderate and left wing of the party wary but through careful diplomacy we have managed to assuage their fears as well. The crisis has passed and we have come out the other side stronger than ever."
col.779.a:0 "¡Unidos en la victoria!"
col.780.t:0 "On the Edge of History"
col.780.d:0 "At today’s meeting of the Council we wasted no time in laying into the treachery of Moreno and Hermida. Accusations of treason flew and emotions got heated. After the denunciations ended Moreno and Hermida exploded into a rage. They launched into a sudden and lengthy rant denouncing our ideals and views. They said the political landscape of Colombia has changed severely since the publication of our Nationalist Manifesto and events have outrun us. They then outlined their own view of a nationalist Colombia, united in spirit and purpose to uplift the Latin American man to his greatest form based on the ideas of Ochoa. The dual speeches lasted a total of seven hours. At its end the ministers sat for a moment, frozen in shock and not a little bit of terror at the sheer anger and rage displayed by the two men. After a moment of silence the room erupted into a chorus of boos and cheers as each man picked their side. Satisfied by their actions, the two men then left the room without another word or so much as glancing at Carreno or Arango. Not long after Villegas, convinced by their passionate speeches, followed them out. Meanwhile Carreno and Arango looked at eachother with surprised and confused glances, still speechless and wondering what came next."
col.780.a:0 "That was something."
col.781.t:0 "Fracture"
col.781.d:0 "Today in a speech in Bogata Fernando Gonzales Ochoa, along with Moreno and Hermida, announced the formation of a new party opposed to the Leopardos. This is done in flagrant violation to the fact that by law, a law which was crafted in part by Moreno and Hermida themselves, political parties in Colombia are banned. The party clearly aims to stir up popular anger at the government and serve as a lightning rod for the former politicians displaced by the Leopardos’s iron fisted rule. While the party is still in its infancy there is a lot to suggest they will quickly become the greatest threat the Leopardos have yet faced. While Ochoa, Moreno and Hermida are rather small political figures, their message that our political program is behind the times resonates with much of the populace and even among our own Council who are now demanding we modernize our Party, starting with a new leader. Some have proposed Gilberto Alzate Avedano, one of the most reactionary Conservatives in government, to lead us to the future. Others worry Gilberto’s greed and extremism would only alienate moderates in the party and tug at the seams of our state. Despite their reservations, for better and for worse, we must make a decision."

col.781.b:0 "Stay the course that has brought us this far."
col.782.t:0 "Skinning the Leopard"
col.782.d:0 "Today our folly has been made plain for all to see. The new party headed by Ochoa has gathered enough popular and military support to launch a bloodless coup. During an emergency meeting of the ruling Leopardos Council the military occupied Bogota and rounded up everybody in the government in one fell swoop. Some loyalist elements in the population and military held out for a few hours but after a few short battles they too bowed to the inevitable. After just two hours of resistance Fernando Ochoa has been named leader of the new Colombia or as he calls it... Otraparte!"

#FOCUS EVENTS
colfocus.1.t:0 "Selecting a New Legislation"
colfocus.1.d:0 "Various new legilations came to the presidential desk after our request to our coalition to bring them to us. Our ministers and our coalition members brought twenty or so new propositions to implement in the near future. The party's secretary selected three of them, which, according to him, are the most effective and less difficult to implement.\n\nThe first one is about the implementation of tax breaks for foreign corporations, in order to boost our heavy industry and minerary economy. According to the paper, a Canadian businessman, CEO of a large multinational corporation, approached our foreign minister with the intention of setting up a new massive emerald industry in Meta in order to work and cut emeralds he will extract in the nearby Boyacá department. Unfortunately, the only remaining large emerald deposit not already conceded to private enterprises is almost entirely located right under a spot sacred to the indigenous people living there.\nThe second proposed legislation is one that is expected to help with the dire situation our armed forces are facing since the loss against Peru, by placing trying to shift the blame away from them and instead make it fall squarely on the shoulders of our predecessors shoulders.\nLastly an APEN senator proposed publicly a reform to the electoral system that will eliminate the possibility, introduced by the previous short-lived Pumarejo administration to form electoral coalitions and run as such. This proposition would be very interesting in that we at the moment are, according to our recent electoral polls, in the lead as a single party outside of coalitions, and because UNIR is leading in that category, once we make unlawful to run as such, they are bound to incour in internal problems as is often the case with socialist infighting. And once that is out of the way we could focus on regrouping the liberal party in one unitary party under our new centrist paradigm.\n\nNow is our time to act, we should focus on..."

Already politicians and revolutionaries who are against what they called 'the government at the boot of the imperialists' used our mistake as a proof of our lack of interest for the Colombian people, our government and the secretary of state justified this 'choice' of name as being 'easier to pronounce for the American people and in other languages such as Russian'.

## Leaders ##
POLITICS_COL_PUMAREJO_DESC:0 "Alfonso López Pumarejo began his rapid rise in politics in 1915, working as a journalist for one of the biggest liberal newspapers of Colombia and as a local representative in the department where he was born, Tolima. His firm stance against the conservative elite and his noteworthy ability to make friends with almost anybody quickly gained him the sympathy and the trust of the public and of many fellow politicians, leading to his election to the Chamber of Representatives in 1925. After a long hegemony by the Conservative Party, the Liberals finally managed to get their candidate Enrique Olaya Herrera elected, however he retained his position for just two years, until the southern neighbor Peru started a border conflict in the Amazonas. Herrera stept down and a militaty junta took control of the situation. The war was eventually lost and because the conservatives had taken side with the military, the electorate rewarded the liberals in the next election that saw Pumarejo himself becoming the 19th president of Colombia. His first measures in the office were the expansion of welfare, scholastic reforms, investments in infrastructure and a reform of the 1886 constitution, but increasing sentiments of conservative nationalism and the rethoric of syndicalist, who blaimed the Liberals and the Junta for the war, forced the president to resign from office.\nLópez Pumarejo, a man of strong will, did not however lose his desire to lead the nation into a better future, as soon as the situation permitted so, he managed to get re-elected to continue what he dubbed 'The March Forward'. With the nation on his knees many look at him as the only one able to let it stand up again."
POLITICS_COL_MONTEJO_DESC:0 "Eduardo Santos Montejo graduated from Colombia's most prestigious law school and immediately began to work as a journalist for 'El Tiempo', a newspaper that in 1913 he bought out and directed with huge success. He then became the campaign manager for the successful 1930 presidential election of liberal candidate Enrique Olaya Herrera. This accomplishment granted him the friendship of the future president Alfonso López Pumarejo and a position as minister of Foreign Affairs for one year, before being moved to the position of governor of Santander in 1931 and eventually, after the war with Peru, when Pumarejo became president, Montejo became his closest adviser. Despite his many personal achievements, his critics still suggest his moderate positions are representative of his inability to take a firm stance on important issues and his rise to power doesn't represent a real democratic alternative to the rising right-wing coalition."
POLITICS_COL_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "A council of ministers and military personnel lead by a congressional appointee is provisionally replacing the democratically elected government and carrying out the regular functions of administration and security keeping until the president can return to his duties."
POLITICS_COL_PEREZ_DESC:0 "Luis Mariano Ospina Pérez's parents were both members of the traditional Colombian political families. His grandfather was president of Colombia between 1857 and 1861. Mariano graduated from the 'Escuela de Minas de Antioquia' as a Mining Engineer and began traveling abroad for two years taking courses on gold mining, sugar cane production, economics and labor relations. Upon his return in 1914, Ospina contacted the leadership of the Conservative Party and was nominated to run for the office of counselor to the City Council of Medellín. He was elected and eventually ran again, successfully, in 1917. Luck was on his side in 1922 when his uncle Pedro Nel Ospina was elected president and helped him become senator for a four-year term. Then, in 1926 he got appointed as Minister of Public Works but only remained in office for eight months, until 1927. That year, Ospina became the first president and the first registered member of the 'Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia'. Because of his high profile and connections within business circles, he eventually managed to become the new official candidate for the presidency of the Conservative Party. Strongly believing in God and Christian values but also in the importance of democracy he is seen as a more moderate candidate compared to the ex-conservative senator Laureano Gómez Castro."
POLITICS_COL_ACEVEDO_DESC:0 "Efrain Rojas Acevedo entered the Cadets Military School with the rank of Second Lieutenant on February 22, 1902. During his military career he worked as Military Aviation Section Chief in the War Ministry, Superior Commandant of the Air Forces in Amazonas during the conflict with Peru, military attaché in Brazil, Army Second Brigade Commandant, Military Forces General Inspector and as the War Ministry’s General Secretary. He began to take an interest in politics following the split in the leadership of the Conservative Party, when Laureano Gómez Castro abandoned the party and formed the Chulavita movement. Rapidly gaining the trust of many ex-officials and business personalities as a staunch moderate and traditionalist inside the military apparatus, he became from 1938 on a prime candidate to replace Mariano Ospina Pérez. Acevedo himself assured that he would accept the role and leave his military career, in the hopes of assuring peace and open dialogue with the opposition. He, in fact, strongly believes that a \"non aggression pact\" with both revolutionaries and reactionary elements is not only possible but should also be the government’s first priority in the short term. However, many highly respected officials, including Pinilla, openly call him \"a traitor\" for his open desire to negotiate with the socialists."
POLITICS_COL_GAITAN_DESC:0 "Jorge Eliécer Gaitán was born and spent his early years in a poor neighborhood in the center of Bogotá called Egipto where he was exposed to rampant poverty and violence. Although he was raised under such an unfortunate environment, his parents were white-collar workers and held rank-and-file positions in the Liberal Party. His interest in politics sparked during his high school years and once enrolled in the National University in Bogotá where he studied law, Gaitán founded the University Center of Cultural Propaganda and organized a massive protest movement against president Marco Fidel Suárez. This caught the interest of many within the Liberal Party, who invited him to join them. He further increased his nationwide popularity supporting the banana workers' strike in Magdalena in 1928. When strikers were fired upon by the army on the orders of the United Fruit Company, resulting in numerous deaths, Gaitán used his skills as a lawyer in order to defend workers' rights and called for accountability to those involved in the massacre. In 1933, he created the Unión Nacional Izquierdista Revolucionaria, or UNIR, as his own dissident political movement after breaking with the Liberal Party with the aim of uniting all left wing revolutionary movements under one big tent. It is said that Gaitán's main political asset is his profound and vibrant oratory skills that makes him arguably Colombia's most influential political figure of our time."
POLITICS_COL_LUIS_CORDOBA_DESC:0 "Diego Luis Córdoba has always represented a figure to look up to for both blacks in Colombia and the people of Chocò, the largely overlooked departement near the Darien Gap where he was born. As a young man he make himself known inside the student movement linked to the Liberal Party and secured a friendship with Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, but their view would eventually diverge, expecially on matters of international politics. Córdoba, had the opportunity in 1925 to visit his friend and painter Nel Gómez Agudelo, who was responsable for starting the Colombian Muralist Movement alongside fellow painter Santiago Martinez Delgado, in the Socialist Republic of Italy in 1925 where he was experimenting new art forms, there they met his Gómez Agudelo's future wife Giuliana Scalaberni who introduced him to the italian syndicalist leaders Giuseppe Di Vittorio and Palmiro Togliatti. It is said Luis Córdoba life changed that day. He briefly joined the Unione Sindacalista during this time and started to embrace the political views of european syndicalists. In 1927, Luis Córdoba returned home and started advocating for the Internationale, founding the Partido Síndicalista Colombiano, a new political movement with strong ties to his mentors' ideas on national unions and internationalism, adding his personal views on afrocolombian unity and bringing about a new era of equality and dialogue between the various ethinicies present in the colombian society."
POLITICS_COL_VIEIRA_DESC:0 "Gilberto Vieira White joined the Partido Totalista Obrero in 1930 when the party was only a few months old and built himself a reputation as the most inflexible maximalist in the country's political landscape. In 1933, Vieira White brought order to the disorganized PTO, establishing a number of cadres which implemented a system of directors running operations over the masses. This new level of organization brought some electoral success to the party and the next year Vieira White was elected to the House of Representatives for Cundinamarca. Due to the failure of the polices of his predicessor, focused on following north american ideals of collaboration with the other socialist parties, he eventually assumed leadership of the PTO during a very agitated party congress in Bucaramanga where the then secretary-general Augusto Durán handed in his resignation only a few years after his nomination to the position. Following Durán’s resignation and the ensuing power vacuum that formed, Vieira White launched a massive campaign to reshape the party in his image and ideals, adopting many of Oswald Mosely and Benito Mussolini's ideas on what Totalism should look like, adapted for the Colombian situation."
POLITICS_COL_GOMEZ_CASTRO_DESC:0 "Laureano Eleuterio Gómez Castro was raised by a Christian fundamentalist family, studied in a Jesuit school from a young age and graduated as an engineer in 1909. Shortly after, Gómez founded the newspaper 'La Unidad', which he later proudly defined as 'the official voice of the priests of Colombia', and joined the Conservative Party. He was then named ambassador to Argentina and was later elected as a senator.\nAlways pushing for a more Catholic integralist agenda, Gómez Castro began working closely alongside the National Populist group Los Leopardos, whom he traveled with on a tour of Europe in order to study ways to implement their common nationalistic goals for Colombia. Returning home from his tour of Europe, Gómez Castro came into conflict with his own party because of the moderate tones the party used against their liberal opponents and the lack address to the threat the new left lead by Jorge Eliécer Gaitán posed to the nation, so he went his way and formed a new movement called Los Chulavitas. Their membership demands absolute trust in the good judgment of their leader and absolute dedication to the Catholic faith, whose values are to be applied to all aspects of life."
POLITICS_COL_PINILLA_DESC:0 "Born in the town of Tunja, in the department of Boyacá, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla developed a great interest in the lives of Simon Bolívar and Gen.Santander from early in his life. The youngest of five brothers in a very conservative family, his father was also a military man who fought in the civil war of 1899-1903. For his part, Pinilla enrolled in the military in 1920. Pinilla’s family connections allowed him to begin his military service as a Captain but later on, during war against Peru, his bravery and valor in the field of battle earned him the \"Orden de Boyacá\", the highest accolade in Colombia's military. When the war was lost most generals found themselves under attack, but not Pinilla, being one of the few to have successfuly halted the devastating advance of the peruvian forces and the only one who actually menaged to make some gains. Because of an overall shortage of high commanders and because of the notoriety he developed after being given the 'Orden de Boyacá', he quickly climbed the ranks and was eventually promoted to the rank of Major General in 1935, since no other candidate was available. He has, since then, assembled a small clandestine group of closely trusted officials under his command, named Movimiento Patria Unida.\nAccording to some, Pinilla has become convinced that he will become immortal in the memory of Colombia. However, whether he manages to achieve such fame and how he plans to do so remains to be seen."
POLITICS_COL_ARANGO_RAMOS_DESC:0 "Not much is known about the infancy and early years of Elíseo Arango Ramos, only that he was born in Bagadó, a small and very poor city in the department of Chocó. He studied law and founded a group of students named Los Leopardos, which sought to bring more young people to the Conservative Party and renew the nation with a new vitality based upon the principles of conservatism and nationalism. From early on, he took interest in esoteric studies which his fellow Leopardos followed along with. His research led him to shape a new type of political theory based on race, traditionalism and national unity which he called \"El Camino Nacionalista\" (The Nacionalist Path). In 1920, he invited the very popular conservative senator Gómez Castro to one of his research meetings and impressed him so much the two of them began forming a strong friendship that eventually led to them travelling to Europe togheter. Above all else, Arango Ramos has been known for his fierce pride for his home department, a territory most often overlooked by the central government. This built him a reputation as he pushed for more spending for Chocó, but mostly his calls fell upon deaf ears. Gaitán and his allies were convinced this would have keep happening, but Arango Ramos is now in a position of strong power and ready to act."
POLITICS_COL_CANO_DESC:0 "María de los Ángeles Cano Márquez is mostly known for being one of the founders of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, the forerunner of the UTC, and for obtaining the honorific title given to prominent charity workers, \"Labor Flower of Medellin\". Having been raised by progressives parents and despite being unable to attend university as women were still not permitted to attend, Cano developed a great interest in politics and writing. In 1926, she was granted the responsibility of organising Antioquia's representation at the 'Third Labor Congress' and married Ignacio Torres Giraldo, a prominent socialist leader. Together, they helped found the SRP. Despite being labelled by conservatives as 'just a rebellious woman', Cano has always been present along with her husband to defend the working class people of Colombia and its many minorities. She gained further nationwide prominence after managing to pressure the government to free the indigenous leader Manuel Quintín Lame, who was detained for trying to establish a self-proclaimed Republic of Indigenas in Cauca and its surrounding territories. Cano retired from public life in 1928, following her imprisonment for leading efforts to organize the strike that led to the Bananeras Massacre. However, the ongoing conflict splitting the country has thrust Cano back into the political sphere and reignited her commitment to lead women and all those oppressed by the status quo."
