AOG_concessions_desc:0"Following the Qing victory over the Fengtian Government, Germany together with the East China Association sought to take advantage over its now dominant position. As a result of a few major deals with the League of Eight Provinces, Germany was able to carve out a semi-official group of territorial concessions, which was to be known as the Aufsichtsrast der Ostasiatische Generalverwaltung.

### Events ###

allgost.9.t:0 "Major Companies Filing for Bankruptcy"
allgost.9.d:0 "With the Economy collapsing, major companies such as Krupp and Hapag-Lloyd have begun to go under. A Bailout is one of the few things that could keep these companies from going bankrupt, but this is very costly and our nation may not be able to afford it at the moment. "
allgost.9.a:0 "We Can't afford it Now!"
allgost.9.b:0 "Bail them Out!"

allgost.10.t:0 "Major Companies Filing for Bankruptcy"
allgost.10.d:0 "With a refusal of a government bailout, many smaller companies within our sphere have gone completely bankrupt. The Largest of these companies that have filed for bankruptcy is the East-Asian Branch of the Bayer AG Chemical Company. As an alarming pattern of bankruptcy continues, many fears that the large conglomerates such as Krupp and Hapag-Lloyd could also go under. If that happens, our economy could be very well doomed. "
allgost.10.a:0 "Not yet..."
allgost.10.b:0 "We can't let those companies fail"

allgost.11.t:0 "The Kaiser Replaces the Government"
allgost.11.d:0 "With the imminent collapse of the Economy, Krupp and the other failing companies were required to take action. This action came in the form of a meeting between Alfred Felix Alwyn von Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach and the Kaiser. This emergency meeting convinced the Kaiser that Commissioner von Falkenhausen was unable to manage the AOG, and thus new leadership is needed. Under a new government, Krupp will run the government from the shadows while the AOG’s board of directors take control of the AOG publicly. This board of directors has Krupp as it’s main benefactor, while smaller companies within the AOG have minor influence. As of now, von Falkenhausen has not made any public statement and has instead retuned to the Military full-time. "
allgost.11.a:0 "The Ostchina-Direktorum is fading.."

allgost.12.t:0 "Government Bailout of Major Companies"
allgost.12.d:0 "Seeing that major companies are on the verge of collapse, Director von Falkenhausen has approved a temporary bailout for Major companies such as Krupp. Though Krupp has not completely recovered, the company has been saved from bankruptcy. Many within the government say that this bailout is not enough, but on our current budget it is the best that we can do. "
allgost.12.a:0 "Let's hope it helps.."

allgost.13.t:0 "The AOG Demands Submission"
allgost.13.d:0 "Recently, the AOG has demanded full submission. They have demanded that the commissions be abolished, and instead the entirety of Nanking’s Wealth will be taken directly by the AOG. This will lead to nothing short of the dissolution of our nation, but we don’t really have any other options. "
allgost.13.a:0 "Fight the German Bastards!"
allgost.13.b:0 "We have no choice but to submit..."

allgost.14.t:0 "A New Agreement with the AOG"
allgost.14.d:0 "The AOG has proposed a new agreement between our nations. If this agreement were to go through, they would have almost complete control of our nation, but we would gain a hefty profit. "
allgost.14.a:0 "No!"
allgost.14.b:0 "It's just good Buisness..."

allgost.15.t:0 "The AOG Demands Submission"
allgost.15.d:0 "Recently, the AOG has demanded full submission. They have demanded that the commissions be abolished, and instead the entirety of Peking’s Wealth will be taken directly by the AOG. This will lead to nothing short of the dissolution of our nation, but we don’t really have any other options."
allgost.15.a:0 "Fight the German Bastards!"
allgost.15.b:0 "We have no choice but to submit..."

allgost.16.t:0 "Our influence in China Grows..."
allgost.16.d:0 "Amidst a season of mixed news, it appears that we have managed to come across a stroke of good fortune. The completion and purchase of the Zhegan railway, a large-scale rail project inside the League of Eight Provinces, has allowed us to spread our influence deeper into Chinese territory. While some responses to the AOG's actions have been less than pleasant, we can safely assume that this is a sign of good things to come."
allgost.16.a:0 "Good to hear."

allgost.17.t:0 "Ostasien and The A.O.G."
allgost.17.d:0 "As the primary centre of German influence in Asia, the work of the Ostasien administration often crosses paths with that of the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatische Generalverwaltung, or AOG. While we retain direct control of Guangzhou and Tsingtau, through the AOG, an administrative body operating inside the League of Eight Provinces, we are able to indirectly profit from several key coastal concession cities, alongside various German-owned infrastructure and industries further inland. The AOG does not answer to Ostasien, nor we to them; nevertheless it is in both of our direct interests to support and protect each other where we are able."
allgost.17.a:0 "Cooperation is key."

##Focuses##
AOG_black_monday:0"Black Monday Collapse"

Our dependency on Germany has left our economy open to collapse if anything went wrong in Germany... and go wrong things did.

If we are to have any shot at survival, we must act now."
AOG_guanzhou_crisis:0"The Guangzhou Crisis"
AOG_guanzhou_crisis_desc:0"As the League of Eight Provinces spirals into complete collapse, the breakaway nations seek it wise to expel us from our rightful land. The Newly Formed Liangguang Clique has seized our concession of Guangzhou for themselves, denying us access to this vital port. We now have two options, to negotiate with the new Government in the South, or to simply use force to take what’s ours. "
AOG_voice_of_reason:0"A Voice of Reason"
AOG_voice_of_reason_desc:0"We are simply too weak to challenge the Liangguang Federal Government for control of the port of Guangzhou. We must simply listen to our advisers, and let this city go. This may be unpopular, but it could very well be the only way to ensure the AOG’s survival. "

AOG_cut_out_middlemen_desc:0"Loyalists in Nanking have triumphed in their struggle. But it no longer makes sense to have Nanking to have hefty concessions to us, when we can just take it all. It is time to cut out the middlemen and take all of Nanking’s wealth for ourselves. "
AOG_55_days_in_peking:0"55 Days in Peking"
AOG_55_days_in_peking_desc:0"The Qing have betrayed us for the last time.

AOG_ostasia_direktorum_victory_desc:0"Even throughout this crisis, the Current Government has survived another day. Falkenhausen has the trust of the people and Germany. With them on his side, the Ostchina-Direktorum is safe, and the status quo lives on for another day. "
AOG_liquidate_krupp_assets:0"Liquidate Krupp Assets"
AOG_liquidate_krupp_assets_desc:0"We simply cannot afford a large bailout of Krupp at the moment. For the time being, we must liquidate their assets and put them temporarily in the hands of the Ostchina-Direktorum. This has shaken trust within Krupp greatly, and some even fear that this could lead to Krupp filing for bankruptcy. "
AOG_new_buisness:0"Restructure Faling Companies"
AOG_new_buisness_desc:0"The Rapidly failing companies cannot survive under the current economic system.

AOG_limited_self_rule:0"Limited Self Rule"
AOG_limited_self_rule_desc:0"A state cannot exist against the wishes of its people. In these trying times of revolution, that saying couldn’t be truer.

AOG_forclose_on_debt:0"Default on our Debt"
AOG_forclose_on_debt_desc:0"On the Board of Directors are many companies that are crushed under the wight of their debts.

AOG_end_corprate_taxes:0"Reformed Tax Code"
AOG_end_corprate_taxes_desc:0"A New Tax code is in order, one that will account for our small area of economic control.

And with this policy in place, we can bring vast riches to the concessions. "
AOG_buyout_chinese_assets:0"Buy Out Chinese Assets"

AOG_military_factories_desc:0"Until we are able to produce our own military equipment, we should create modern armouries for our army.

POLITICS_WILHELM_II_CHINA_DESC:0 "Though still sitting on his throne thousands of miles away in Berlin, Kaiser Wilhelm has also ascended to the role of Emperor of China. With the Mandate of Heaven thinly backing up his claim to rule and the might of both the AOG and the Chinese Expeditionary Force behind him, Kaiser Weilian’s rule has been solidified and his position on the Dragon Throne cemented. From abroad and deep within the Forbidden Palace, this Kaiser of the Chinesisches Kaiserreich has become the symbol of German dominance in Asia for all the world to bear witness to."
